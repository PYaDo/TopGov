The present review identifies the objectives of the automation studies and the aspects of those steps that were automated. In so doing, the various ML techniques used, challenges, limitations and scope of further research are explained. Methods: Accessible published literature studies that primarily focus on automation of study selection, study quality assessment, data extraction and data synthesis portions of SLR. Twenty-nine studies were analyzed. Results: This review identifies the objectives of the automation studies, steps within the study selection, study quality assessment, data extraction and data synthesis portions that were automated, the various ML techniques used, challenges, limitations and scope of further research. Discussion: We describe uses of NLP/TM techniques to support increased automation of systematic literature reviews. This area has attracted increase attention in the last decade due to significant gaps in the applicability of TM to automate steps in the SLR process. There are significant gaps in the application of TM and related automation techniques in the areas of data extraction, monitoring, quality assessment and data synthesis. There is thus a need for continued progress in this area, and this is expected to ultimately significantly facilitate the construction of systematic literature reviews.'), \n",

governance and hence help eliminate all irrelevant  literature, which might be confused with the concept of data governance.', 'For instance,  often researchers and practitioners confuse between data governance and data manage- ment.', 'The definition of data management provided by the Data Management Associa- tion (DAMA) is: “data management is the development, execution and supervision of  plans, policies, programs and practices that control, protect, deliver and enhance the  value of data and information assets”.', 'Data management in general focuses on the de- fining of the data element, how it is stored, structured, and moved.', 'DAMA defines data  governance as: “the exercise of authority, control and shared decision-making (plan- ning, monitoring and enforcement) over the management of data assets”.', 'Data govern- ance is therefore, high-level planning and control over data management[26].', 'Authors  of [27] have also argued that data governance is different from data management; that  data governance complements data management, but does  not replace it.', 'Authors of  [28] defined data governance as “a system of decision rights and accountabilities for  information-related processes, executed according to agreed-upon models which de- scribe who can take what actions with what information, and when, under what cir- cumstances,  using  what  methods”.', 'While  authors  of  [6]  defined  data  governance  as  “specifies the framework for decision rights and accountabilities to encourage desira- ble behavior in the use of data.', 'To promote desirable behavior, data governance devel- ops and implements corporate-wide data policies, guidelines, and standards that are  consistent with the organization’s mission, strategy, values, norms, and culture”.', 'However, there is not an official definition about what is data governance.', 'For an- swering this question, this study is going to refer some different definitions offered by  important organisations.', \"The definitions above emphasize the significance of the ter- minals though which data governance activities can be executing on data related assets  which support the organisation's strategy.\", 'These definitions did not give equal prominence for the  data governance with cloud computing technology context.', 'So, this requires to under- stand the data governance and cloud computing in depth.', 'Some other researchers or practitioners may also confuse between Information Tech- nology Governance (IT governance) and data governance.', 'IT governance is much more  mature area with the first publications on the topic released about four decades[29],  [30], while data governance is still under-researched.', 'IT governance as “in- tegral  part  of  enterprise  governance  and  have  potential  to  provide  mechanisms  for  leadership and organisational structures and processes that ensure the organisation’s  IT  sustains  and  extends  the  organisation’s  strategies  and objectives”.', 'Organizations  with mature IT governance practices tend to have stronger alignment between IT and  business[31].', 'Therefore, the different between data governance and IT governance is  data  governance  focus  on  govern  organisation  data  in  different  technology  environ- ment, while IT governance focus on govern IT equipment.', 'In addition, [7] argues that  the organisations should get responsibility for data out of the IT department.', \"Besides  of IT governance, data governance also has a significant role in aligning the organisa- tion's business[7].\", 'Data governance can be used to solve assortment of business issues  related to data and information[6], [32], [33].', 'Authors of [29] also argued that a data  governance model helps organisations to structure and document the accountabilities  for their data quality.', 'Authors of [34] have explicitly demonstrated that data governance  is different from IT governance in principal and practices.', 'In principal, data governance  is  designed for  the governance  of  data  assets,  while  IT  governance  makes decisions  about IT investments, IT application portfolio, and the IT projects portfolio.', \"In practice,  IT governance is designed primarily around an organization's hardware and applica- tions not its data.\", 'In addition, all  existing sources have hitherto only addressed data governance, partially[29].', 'The fact  that organisations need to take into account many aspects into consideration when im- plementing data governance has been neglected so far[36].', 'Moreover, some researchers  show  that  if  organisations  who  do  not  implement  an  effective  data  governance,  can  quickly loose any competitive advantage[28], [35].', 'Data governance requires the involvement and commitment of all staff with full  sponsorship by the management and senior-level executive sponsorship in any organi- zation[37], [38].', 'Recently, many organisations

and compliance, and provide guides to help organisations get started down  this path [63].', 'According to MeriTalk report in 2014, only 44% of IT professionals in  the federal government believe their agencies have mature data governance practices in  the cloud.', 'This report also suggests that there are about 56% of agencies currently in  the process of implementing data stewardship or data governance programs [109].', 'As  results, also the work that provide by industry regarding cloud data governance is quite  enough to achieve cloud data governance goals, and to provide good solutions to deci-', 'Critical challenges to implement data governance in cloud  ', 'The adoption of new technology such as cloud computing in organisations require a  good data governance strategy for the adoption to be successful  [4].', 'There are many  challenging issues  which  could  affect the  implementation  of data  governance in  the  cloud, these can be classified as technological, legal, and business, and are discussed  below.', 'Technological Challenges  ', 'Security is one of the major concerns for organisations who seek to adopt cloud  computing[110], with some managers reporting that their sensitive data will never  be in the cloud [111].', 'There are several specific areas such as hardware and soft- ware, which require important security attention in the cloud environments.', 'Issues  to consider in security include, the security of data at rest and motion, the security  of cloud data storage, and Incident response[112].', 'Privacy and data protection considerations are concerns for organisations inter- ested in implementing data governance in the cloud.', 'This is because an organiza- tion  using  cloud  may  not  have  full  control  of  their  data  stored  on  cloud-based  servers [113].', 'Cloud providers also don’t guarantee better confidentiality of cus- tomers data [114].', 'Therefore, the aspect of security and confidentiality must in- terface to protect the data in enterprises.', 'Availability has become a concern to adopting the cloud and implementing data  governance in organisations  [115].', 'A number of factors exist which negatively  impact on availability in the cloud, these include security, protecting the confi- dentiality and integrity of data, and Identifying single points of failure [115].', 'Performance is one of the concerns for organisations when moving their service  and data to the cloud.', 'It includes more extensive concepts such as reliability, en- ergy efficiency, and scalability  [116], [117].', 'There are many factors which can  influence the performance of the cloud, such as security, recovery, service level  agreements, network bandwidth, storage capacity, availability, number of users  and data location [117].', 'Data classification in the cloud is another challenge for cloud consumers and pro- viders.', 'This challenge emanates from the lack of classification of data based on  sensitivity.', 'The protection of sensitive data is important for any organisation when  moving data to the cloud.', 'Classification of data facilitates the implementation of  appropriate security controls such as role-based access, among many others.', 'This  has also been a major area of concern for consumers of cloud services, because  they are not aware who is accessing their data.', 'As a result, assuring cloud service  consumers that their data is not being accessed by unauthorized parties has been  a major challenge to cloud service providers [118].', 'Data migration is another significant concern in cloud computing which is related   to data governance [119], [120].', 'There are a number of considerations that should  be made when migrating data between different cloud systems.', 'These considera- tions include scalability, availability, load balancing, cost-efficiency and availa- bility  [121].', 'Load balancing ensures that servers are  not overwhelmed by data.', 'Requests are distributed between multiple servers, which ensures very quick op- erations on the data stored on the cloud [36].', 'Legal Challenges ', 'Legal  contracts  written  between  cloud  actors  are  expressed  in  very  complicated  statements.', 'Hence, customers find it very difficult to understand legal and regulatory  implications of such agreements [122].', 'The legal framework for cloud computing still  remains at an unsatisfactory level in many countries [123].', 'For example, Middle East- ern countries and Africa lack compulsory regulatory support for data protection, gov- ernance, and privacy [122], [124].', 'There are many legal factors which affect an organ- ization when implementing data governance in the cloud.', 'These  include compliance  with regulations, and physical location [102].', 'In addition, statutory, regulatory, and le- gal requirements differ by market sector and jurisdiction, and they can change the re- sponsibilities of both cloud consumers and cloud providers.', 'Organisational/Business Challenges  ', 'Cloud computing supports organisations in embracing new business opportunities to  improve their current business performance, respond to crisis  situations, and change  their current business model [34], [102].', 'In addition, data governance strategy is essen- tial for supporting business functions in any organisations [4].', 'There are many organi- zational factors that affect an organisation’s implementation of data governance pro- grams  in  the  cloud.', 'These    include  top  management  support,  organization  size,  and  technology readiness [102], [126].', 'Additionally, currently there is no single approach  to the implementation of data governance in all organisations.', 'Literature review identi- fies a significant gap in the lack of appropriate and effective data governance in the  cloud.', 'Organisations need to embrace data governance program in the cloud, no matter  where data is created, used and stored.', 'Nonetheless, technological, legal, and organiza- tional  challenges  are  among  the  many  challenges  that  impact  on  implementing  data  governance in the cloud.', 'Key Dimensions for Cloud Data Governance ', 'Many researchers have recognized a need to implement data governance for cloud  computing[47],[105],[40],[48].', 'To  implement  data  governance  for  cloud  computing,  services must determine the data governance key dimension.', 'Identifying the specific  data  governance  dimensions  for  the  cloud  services  is  potentially  a  complex  process,  consequently, it needs more investigative efforts involving different stakeholders.', 'Thus,  the study presented here is based merrily on analyzing the relevant knowledge in the  public domain, following the Analytic Theory[127].', 'In this study the Analytic Theory ', 'IT  and  the  cloud technology.', 'The authors in [68] urge that the use of the analytic theory to describe  or classify specific dimensions or characteristics of individuals, groups,  situations, or  events,  by  summarizing  the  commonalities  found  in  discrete  observations”.', 'Frame- works, classification schema, and taxonomies are numerous in IS.', 'The analytic theory  has been chosen as a concept for this study to identify data governance dimensions for  the cloud services.', 'To use analytic theory for making data governance dimensions, we  follow a number of steps.', 'Foremost, to understand the state-of-the art of data governance  for traditional IT, and the cloud.', 'In addition, to identify specific dimensions or charac- teristics of data governance and cloud computing.', 'Finally, to develop the key data gov- ernance dimensions for cloud computing based on the definitions of data governance  and its factors that present in the literature review.', 'To the best of our knowledge, and  following the aforementioned systematic review of literature, there is no published re- search that defines key dimensions of data governance for cloud computing.', 'In contrast,  for traditional IT (non-cloud), although few, there is some reported research.', 'As illus- trated above, data governance for non-cloud and cloud, albeit with some similarities at  a higher level, differ significantly in the details, in addition to some new factors related  only to the cloud technology mentioned.', 'Therefore, it is useful to discuss these similar- ities and differences.', 'Data governance for traditional IT (non-cloud) could be built upon  six dimensions, which are described below:  ', 'Data governance function,   2.', 'Data governance structure,   3.', 'Organisational,   4.', 'Technical,   5.', 'Environmental   6.', 'Measuring& monitoring tool.', 'The cloud paradigm however, introduces new factors, which needs to be taken into  consideration when designing and implementing any cloud data governance program.', 'These new factors are described below.', 'By considering these new factors, the key di- mensions for implementing data governance for cloud computing are depicted in Fig.7.  •  Cloud deployment model: it is the important factor that consider in the data  governance.', 'There are primarily four cloud deployment models that differ in  risk and concern about control and security, and contractual barriers.', 'That are  public, private, hybrid and community.', 'To address data governance, the level  of risk and complexity of each cloud deployment must be taken into consider- ation[9].', 'Service delivery model: cloud services can be categorized into three delivery  models; Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and  In- frastructure as a Service (IaaS)[128].', 'Depending on the model, the cloud con- sumer loses control on their data, since the cloud provider has responsibility  to manage some components in these model[40].', 'Therefore, the data govern- ance teams have to consider all characteristics of the service delivery model, ', 'Cloud Actors: are also a critical factor into data governance for the cloud ser- vices.', 'Cloud actors refers to a person or an organization that participates in  processes or a transaction, and/or performs tasks in cloud computing environ- ment.', 'NISTs cloud computing reference architecture distinguishes five major  actors; the cloud consumer, the cloud provider, the cloud auditor, the cloud  carrier, and the cloud broker [9].', 'All of the aforementioned have special roles  and responsibilities in the cloud, so the data governance teams must clearly  define the roles and responsibilities for all cloud actors.', 'Service Level Agreement (SLA): One key issue for the cloud consumer is the  provision  of  governance  for  data  which  it  no  longer  directly  controls[129].', 'Contractual barriers increase between cloud actors.', 'A SLA is an agreement  that serves as the foundation of expectation for service(s) between the cloud  consumer and the provider.', 'The agreement states what services will be pro- vided, how they will be provided, and what happens if the expectations are not  met.', 'Therefore, SLA is pivotal in data governance.', 'Thus, the cloud consumer  and provider have to negotiate all aspects of data governance before develop- ing the SLA.', 'As a result, these agreements are in place to protect both parties.', 'Fig.', 'Key dimensions for cloud data governance.', 'Data governance function: This refers to master activities for data governance,  including functions which data governance teams have to take in account when ', 'The outcomes from data gov- ernance  function  activities  include  policies,  principles,  processes,  decision  rights,  roles  and  responsibilities,  communication  plans  and  change  manage- ment.', 'This is considered the master dimension for data governance, nonethe- less, it must comply with other dimensions to develop an effective data gov- ernance.', 'Data  governance  structure:  Designing  data  governance  structure  is  an  im- portant factor in ensuring that requisite roles and responsibilities are addressed  throughout the enterprise at the right organizational levels [28].', 'Several com- mon data governance roles have been identified in existing studies, including  the  following:  executive  sponsor,  data  governance  council,  data  governance  office, chief Steward, business and technical data Steward [7],[31].', 'These roles  have to collaborate to formulate data governance bodies.', 'Organisational: Organisational factors are important for data governance to be  successful [30].', 'Data governance requires change management in the organi- zation, in addition to the participation and commitment of IT staff, business  management,  and  senior-level  executive  sponsorship  in  organizations  [31].', 'Moreover, top management support is considered as the critical success factor  for  implementing  data  governance  [28].', 'Staff  in  organizations  need  to  learn  data governance functions, demanding top management support to enhance an  organization staffs’ skillset.', 'Technical: Technology is also a key element for data governance success [37].', 'Therefore,  lack  of  technology  considers  common  barriers  to  successful  data  governance.', 'Technical factors encapsulate data management issues that affect  organisations’  strategies  such  as  security,  privacy,  quality  and  integrity.', 'As  such, it is incumbent upon organisations which anticipate to implement data  governance, to assess all technological characteristics available at the organi- sations, to effectively implement data governance.', 'Environmental: Environmental factors refers to external environmental consid- erations such as government legislation, and data protection act[102].', 'The data  governance teams have to consider all environmental aspects when designing  data governance functions.', 'This means that data governance functions have to  comply with the environments.', 'This consideration immensely contributes  to- wards building strong data governance in the organisation.', 'Measuring & Monitoring Tool: Measuring and monitoring supports ongoing  data  governance  efforts  to  ensure  that  all  incoming  and  existing  data  meets  business  rules  [38].', 'By  adding  a  monitoring  component  to  data  governance  program, data quality efforts are enhanced, which in turn renders data much  more reliable [26].', 'As mentioned above, the above six dimensions are common  when implementing data governance for cloud or traditional IT, however, they ', 'Table 11 is an attempt to show some of these  differences.', 'Table 11.', 'Illustrates how the six common defined dimensions differ between the Cloud par- adigm and

and risk.', 'Despite data governance gaining in importance in recent years, a holistic view on data governance, which could guide both practitioners and researchers, is missing.', 'In this review paper, we aim to close this gap and develop a conceptual framework for data governance, synthesize the literature, and provide a research agenda.', 'We base our work on a structured literature review including 145 research papers and practitioner publications published during 2001-2019.', 'We identify the major building blocks of data governance and decompose them along six dimensions.', 'The paper supports future research on data governance by identifying ﬁve research areas and displaying a total of 15 research questions.', 'Furthermore, the conceptual framework provides an overview of antecedents, scoping parameters, and governance mechanisms to assist practitioners in approaching data governance in a structured manner.', 'Introduction', 'Data governance is the exercise of authority and control over the management of data (DAMA International, 2009, p.', 'It aims at implementing a corporate-wide data agenda (Dyché & Levy, 2006, pp.', 'Carretero, Gualo, Caballero, & Piattini, 2017, p.', 'Otto, 2011a, p.', 'DAMA International, 2009, p.', 'Morabito, 2015, p.', 'While data governance used to be a nice to have in the past, today it is taking on a higher level of importance in enterprises and governmental institutions (Haneem, Kama, Taskin, Pauleen, & Abu Bakar, 2019, pp.', 'This is due to some key trends.', 'The amount of data created annually on the whole planet is expected to increase from 4.4 zettabytes in 2013 to 44 zettabytes in 2020 (IDC, 2014, p.', 'The growing data volumes from diverse sources cause data inconsistencies that need to be identiﬁed and addressed before deci- sions are made based on incorrect data.', 'Companies introduce more self- service reporting and analytics, which create the need for a common understanding of data across the organization.', 'The continuing impact of regulatory requirements such as the General Data Protection Reg- ulation (GDPR) increases the pressure on companies to have a strong handle on what data is stored where, and how the data is being used.', 'Organizations are forced to overcome their challenges regarding in- accurate and incomplete data (Kim & Cho, 2018, p.', 'Morabito,', 'Nielsen, Persson, & Madsen, 2018, p.', 'Khatri & Brown, 2010, p.', 'Despite the growing importance of data governance, the current view on this topic is fragmented.', 'Publications either address data governance with a focus on speciﬁc decision domains such as data quality, data security, and data lifecycle (e.g., Donaldson & Walker, 2004, p.', 'IBM, 2014, p.', 'Otto, 2011c, pp.', 'Tallon, Ramirez, & Short, 2014, p.', 'Brous, Herder, & Janssen, 2016, pp.', 'Lee, Zhu, & Jeﬀery, 2017, p.', 'Neﬀ, Schosser, Zelt, Uebernickel, & Brenner, 2013, p.', 'Rasouli, Trienekens, Kusters, & Grefen, 2016, p.',

'Furthermore, the authors do not describe the antecedents and consequences of data governance, which are necessary to understand the factors that motivate the adoption of diﬀerent data governance practices and the eﬀects of those practices.', 'To overcome these deﬁ- ciencies, we attempt to methodologically analyze and synthesize the literature on data governance and provide a ﬁrm foundation for future research.', 'The following two questions frame our structured literature review of 145 research papers and practitioner publications covering data governance published up to April 2019: What are the building blocks of data governance?', 'Where do we lack in knowledge about data governance?', 'The remainder of this paper is structured as follows.', 'First, we ex- plain our literature search and review method.', 'Second, we describe the conceptual framework of data governance that served as the structure for our review of the state of knowledge.', 'Third, we present the results of the actual review and synthesis of the data governance literature.', 'Fourth, we highlight gaps in our understanding of data governance and propose a research agenda, which contains insightful questions for fu- ture research.', 'Fifth, we conclude with a summary.', 'Literature search and review', 'Similar to other existing literature reviews such as Gong and Janssen (2019) and Senyo, Liu, and Eﬀah (2019), our approach com- prised a structured, topic-centric literature review.', 'We aimed to better describe the domain of data governance and synthesize the relevant knowledge as available in peer-reviewed scientiﬁc literature as well as in selected practitioner publications.', 'In doing so, we followed best practices for literature reviews (Rowe, 2014; vom Brocke et al., 2009; Webster & Watson, 2002; Zorn & Campbell, 2006).', 'Fig.', 'First, we conducted a keyword-based search (Ismagilova, Hughes, Dwivedi, & Raman, 2019, p.', 'Olanrewaju, Hossain, Whiteside, & Mercieca, 2020, p.', 'Rowe, 2014, p.', 'The keyword-based search helped us to avoid bias towards well-known authors or well-cited pa- pers.', 'Through an initial step of probing searches, we identiﬁed “data governance” and “information governance” as search terms.', 'We in- cluded “information governance” as a search term since it is often used interchangeably with “data governance” (e.g. In, Bradley, Bichescu, & Autry, 2019, p.', 'Rasouli, Trienekens et al., 2016, p.', 'Tallon et al., 2014, p.', 'We used the databases in Table 1 that provide access to peer-reviewed IS journals as well as proceedings of leading conferences such as the European Conference on Information Systems and the Americas Conference on Information Systems.', 'We included conference papers since recent research may not yet have been, or may never be, published in journals.', 'We conducted the ﬁnal keyword-based search in April 2019 covering the period from 2002 to 2019.', 'This step resulted in a total of 483 hits across all databases.', 'Next, we conducted a qualitative assessment consisting of two steps.', 'First, we ﬁltered articles', 'We also removed duplicate articles.', 'This step reduced the number of hits to 88.', 'Second, we read those remaining 88 articles and excluded non-scientiﬁc journal articles and papers that referred to data governance only in passing.', 'This left 55 papers to be included in the review.', 'Second, we conducted a backward and forward search of the above 55 papers (vom Brocke et al., 2009, p.', 'We again applied the two-step qualitative assessment described above to exclude non-relevant papers.', 'However, we expanded the assessment to include seminal books on data governance and publications by industry associations such as the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and inter-gov- ernmental organizations such as the Organisation for Economic Co- operation and Development (OECD).', 'We added these publications to obtain a comprehensive view of data governance and reduce systematic biases by simply choosing a set of scientiﬁc journals and conference papers (Boell & Cecez-Kecmanovic, 2015, p.', 'The backward search resulted in 41 relevant papers.', 'For the forward search, we used Google Scholar.', 'We reviewed an additional 44 relevant papers.', 'Third, we considered selected publications not identiﬁed through either the keyword-based search or the backward and forward search.', 'These included one scientiﬁc paper recommended during the review process and four practitioner publications.', 'The latter comprised pub- lications by the European Foundation for Quality Management (EFQM), the Information Systems Audit and Control Association (ISACA), and by leading data governance tooling vendors IBM and Informatica (Peyret & Goetz, 2014, pp.', 'The third step resulted in 5 additional publications.', 'In total, we reviewed 145 publications on data governance.', 'Table 1 summarizes the search process and results.', 'Fig.', 'All relevant publications were categorized according to their nature (scientiﬁc or practice-oriented) and format (papers in journals and conference proceedings, theses, publications by industry associations and inter-governmental organizations, publications by software ven- dors and consultants, books).', 'Table 2 presents an overview of the publications within the scope of this literature review.', 'Data governance deﬁnition and framework', 'As proposed by Zorn and Campbell (2006, p.', 'Furthermore, we present a conceptual framework for data governance to structure the review.', 'The conceptual framework builds on the rich data we have collected during our literature search process.', 'We did not ﬁnd a standard deﬁnition of data governance in scho- larly literature or in the set of practitioner publications.', 'Hence, we analyzed every deﬁnition of data governance in our set of papers and used open coding to ﬁnd common characteristics.', 'The analysis led us to the following deﬁnition of data governance: Data governance spe- ciﬁes a cross-functional framework for managing data as a stra- tegic enterprise asset.', 'In doing so, data governance speciﬁes de- cision rights

(bold text) is our own but corresponds to the char- acterization of data governance in the reviewed literature.', 'Our deﬁni- tion of data governance has six parts.', 'First, data governance is a cross- functional eﬀort.', 'It enables collaboration across functional boundaries and data subject areas.', 'Second, data governance is a framework, which provides structure and formalization for the management of data.', 'Third, data governance focuses on data as a strategic enterprise asset.', 'Data is the representation of facts in diﬀerent formats.', 'Fourth, data governance speciﬁes decision rights and accountabilities for an organiza- tion’s decision-making about its data.', 'It determines what decisions need to be made about data, how these decisions are made, and who in the organization has the rights to make these decisions.', 'Fifth, data gov- ernance develops data policies, standards, and procedures.', 'These artifacts should be consistent with the organization’s strategy and promote de- sirable behavior in the use of data.', 'Finally, data governance monitors compliance.', 'It includes the implementation of controls to ensure that data policies and standards are followed.', 'This deﬁnition also considers the diﬀerentiation between data governance and data management made by several authors.', 'Data governance refers to what decisions must be made and who makes those decisions, whereas data management is about making those decisions as part of the day-to-day execution of data governance policies (Dyché & Levy, 2006, pp.', 'Hagmann, 2013, pp.', 'Khatri & Brown, 2010, p.', 'Otto, 2013, p.', 'Table 3 shows how the characteristics of data governance in our deﬁ- nition correspond to the reviewed set of papers.', 'We performed the analysis for all data governance deﬁnitions in the papers, and the table provides selected excerpts for illustration.', 'We aimed to synthesize the literature according to a conceptual framework that allows us to structure the review of important concepts of data governance.', 'A conceptual framework “explains, either graphi- cally or in narrative form, the main things to be studied – the key factors, constructs or variables – and the presumed relationships among them” (Miles & Huberman, 1994, p.', 'It brings together the diﬀerent currents of thought and helps identify directions for future research (Marshall & Rossman, 2011, p.', 'The process of creating this con- ceptual framework was as follows: We applied open coding analysis techniques suggested by Corbin & Strauss (2015, pp.', 'We used a concept matrix as described by Webster & Watson (2002, p.', 'We then mapped these concepts against ex- isting frameworks and found that the IT governance cube of Tiwana, Konsynski, and Venkatraman (2014) and the framework for data de- cision domains of Khatri and Brown (2010) provided useful starting points for grouping these concepts.', 'We used the dimensions proposed in those frameworks to create our conceptual framework for data gov- ernance.', 'However, we made several changes to the dimensions to suit the needs of our review.', 'Among others, we divided the content di- mension of Tiwana et al.', 'Khatri & Brown.', 'Fig.', 'The conceptual', 'Fig.', 'Governance mechanisms represent the core dimension of the framework and encompass structural, procedural, and relational mechanisms.', 'The organizational scope determines the orga- nizational expansiveness of data governance and roughly corresponds to the unit of analysis.', 'We diﬀerentiate between the intra-organiza- tional and the inter-organizational scope.', 'The data scope pertains to the data asset an organization needs to govern.', 'We distinguish between traditional data and big data.', 'The domain scope covers the data decision domains, to which governance mechanisms are applied.', 'They comprise data quality, data security, data architecture, data lifecycle, meta data, and data storage and infrastructure.',

research agenda comprises ﬁve major areas: (1) governance mechanisms; (2) scope of data governance; (3) antecedents of data governance; (4) consequences of data governance; and (5) generalizability and replicability of ﬁndings.', 'Governance mechanisms', 'Determining the data owner can be a diﬃcult task (Vilminko- Heikkinen & Pekkola, 2019, p.', 'Current literature does not provide a common understanding of the data owner role.', 'First, we found am- biguous deﬁnitions regarding the ownership and accountability for data.', 'Some deﬁnitions clearly allocate accountability for data to a dedicated data owner role (Otto, 2011c, p.', 'Dreibelbis et al., 2008, p.', 'Dyché & Levy, 2006, pp.', 'NASCIO, 2008, p.', 'Researchers should further analyze in which cases a dedicated data owner role is beneﬁcial.', 'Second, we lack knowledge of how the data owner is identiﬁed.', 'Do organizations de- termine the data owner based on the application, where the data is stored, or based on the process, which uses the data?', 'Vilminko- Heikkinen & Pekkola (2019, pp.', 'Finnish municipality, but the data owner concept and approach remains un- clear during both projects.', 'Future research should further investigate the process of data ownership determination.', 'Third, we know little about the scope of data ownership.', 'For a regulation-driven data gov- ernance program, the scope might be narrowly deﬁned focusing on key data elements, whereas for an analytics-driven program it might be more meaningful to widen the scope to comprise entire data domains.', 'Future research should conduct a richer analysis on how to deﬁne the scope of data ownership, as it might impact the eﬀectiveness of data governance design.', 'The allocation of decision-making authority also requires further research.', 'As part of our review, we identiﬁed basic categories regarding the allocation of decision-making authority, i.e. hierarchical posi- tioning, functional positioning, and the positioning of decision-making authority on a continuum ranging from centralized to decentralized.', 'However, we do not know which allocation of decision-making au- thority is most suitable under which circumstances.', 'In case of func- tional positioning, Otto (2011b, pp.', 'However, this proposition requires substantiation through quantitative empirical studies on a larger and more representative sample of companies.', 'Researchers should analyze whether allocating decision-making authority to a business function is more eﬀective than allocating it to an IT function or a separate data governance organization.', 'Weber et al.', 'However, they do not provide empirical evidence of this contingency approach.', 'Researchers should conduct further studies to analyze under which circumstances a centralized, decentralized, or hybrid allocation of decision-making authority is most suitable.', 'Un- derstanding how to allocate decision-making authority could greatly improve the eﬀectiveness of data governance.', 'Furthermore, data governance is an ongoing program and a con- tinuous improvement process (Cheng et al., 2017, p.', 'DAMA International, 2009, p.', 'New internal data needs and changing ex- ternal demands such as legal and regulatory requirements force data governance to evolve and adapt (Tallon et al., 2014, p.', 'Weber et al., 2009, p.', 'However, most of the reviewed publications take a “one-oﬀ” perspective on data governance and do not reﬂect how data governance arrangements might need to change over time.', 'We identi- ﬁed a few publications which focus on the evolution of speciﬁc data governance concepts such as the evolution of the data governance strategy (Tallon et al., 2013), data ownership (Vilminko-Heikkinen & Pekkola, 2019), and data governance eﬀectiveness (Otto, 2013).', 'Future research should build on these results and conduct further qualitative, quantitative, and longitudinal studies to deepen the knowledge about data governance evolution.', 'The ﬁndings could provide a better un- derstanding of which governance mechanisms should be applied during diﬀerent phases of a data governance program.', 'Scope of data governance', 'Data governance for ecosystems of public and private organizations is another promising research area.', 'Firms increasingly collaborate with partnering companies, outsourcing vendors, and cloud service provi- ders to manage parts of the data value chain (Bruhn, 2014, pp.', 'Panian, 2010, p.', 'Research institutions team up and form dis- tributed research networks which allow researchers to use data from multiple institutions (Kim et al., 2014, p.', 'Current research has started investigating data governance for speciﬁc types of inter-orga- nizational settings such as cloud computing (Al-Ruithe, Benkhelifa, & Hameed, 2016), platform ecosystems (Lee et al., 2017), dynamic busi- ness networking (Rasouli, Trienekens et al., 2016), supply chains (In et al., 2019), and inter-organizational data collaborations (van den Broek & van Veenstra, 2015).', 'However, we do not know much about how organizations ensure data ownership and control in inter-organi- zational relationships.', 'Especially the exchange of sensitive data such as personal health information raises new concerns about privacy (Winter & Davidson, 2018, p.', 'Future research should investigate which data governance mechanisms can help organizations to retain control over their data in inter-organizational settings.', 'Researchers should also ex- plore governance practices that support individuals and groups in ef- fectively co-determining how their data is governed and (re)used.', 'For example, additional governance bodies might be required to monitor compliance and balance interests in inter-organizational settings.', 'Fur- thermore, companies need to create a standardized and trustworthy data exchange environment (Cohn, 2015, p.', 'Rasouli, 2016, p.', 'Rasouli, Trienekens et al., 2016, pp.', 'Future research should in- vestigate how meta data and other concepts can be used to facilitate interoperability between organizations and traceability of data prove- nance.', 'Finally, the complexity of ecosystems increases with the number of participating organizations (van den Broek & van Veenstra, 2015, p.', 'Researchers should conduct further qualitative studies to explore the most appropriate governance designs for one-to-one, one-to-many, and', 'R.', 'Abraham, et al.', 'International Journal of Information Management 49 (2019) 424–438', 'Consequences of data governance', 'Data governance for big data has been a speciﬁc focus in research (e.g. Kim & Cho, 2018; Malik, 2013; Winter & Davidson, 2018).', 'As organizations try to integrate and use big data, having an eﬀective data governance design becomes substantive.', 'However, no general data governance approach for big data has been agreed upon.', 'We identiﬁed four major big data challenges and research opportunities regarding data governance.', 'First, data quality for big data needs to be addressed given the incomplete and often uncertain nature of big data (Lemieux, Gormly, & Rowledge, 2014, p.', 'Malik, 2013, p.', 'Data quality issues concerning big data could become an increasing risk, as organi- zations keep on applying data-driven decision-making (Kim & Cho, 2018, p.', 'Morabito, 2015, p.', 'Future research should determine how data quality metrics should be deﬁned for big data and how ac- curate big data needs to be.', 'Second, big data raises concerns regarding privacy infringements (e.g. Tallon, 2013, p.', 'Winter & Davidson, 2018, p.', 'The extent to which organizations can act upon big data insights is still an unresolved issue (Tallon, 2013, p.', 'For example, combining data sources to reveal new patterns could cause un- anticipated exposure of personal habits (IBM, 2014, p.', 'Researchers should explore governance mechanisms that enable innovation through big data analytics with simultaneous consideration of privacy require- ments.', 'This could include policies determining the ethical and per- missible use of big data without violating privacy rights.', 'Third, not all data is equally useful, but have varying degrees of value (Malik, 2013, p.', 'However, the deﬁnition of the intrinsic data value and the methods of how to measure it still prompt questions (Kooper et al., 2011, pp.', 'Malik, 2013, p.', 'Future research should investigate how to quantify the intrinsic data value.', 'The results could help com- panies to adjust data retention policies and determine when to migrate data to low-cost storage tiers and when to delete data.', 'Finally, in- tegrating big data with traditional enterprise data poses challenges (Malik, 2013, pp.', 'Data is often fragmented and stored in in- compatible IT systems (Lemieux et al., 2014, p.', 'Morabito, 2015 p.', 'The reason for these data silos is often a lack of cross-organiza- tional collaboration (Nielsen et al., 2018, p.', 'Researchers should investigate how governance mechanisms can be applied to foster cross- organizational collaboration to deconstruct data silos.', 'Antecedents of data governance', 'We found that organizations need to design data governance con- sidering contextual factors.', 'Research informing these design decisions will be useful as it helps organizations to tailor data governance ac- cording to their speciﬁc environment and needs.', 'Although these ante- cedents have received some attention (Tallon et al., 2014; Weber et al., 2009), we do not know much about their relative importance, their interrelations, and their causal chains.', 'We found in the review that many data governance approaches do not consider contextual factors, which seems reductionist and unrealistic.', 'For future research, rather than ignoring the context, it would be useful if researchers analyzed contextual factors and their impact on data governance design and implementation.', 'This includes the investigation of additional ante- cedents such as speciﬁc industries, ﬁrm size, and corporate culture (Begg & Caira, 2012, p.', 'Cave, 2017, pp.', 'NASCIO, 2008, p.', 'Neﬀ et al., 2013, p.', 'Yu & Foster, 2017, p.', 'Based on those ﬁnd- ings, organizations could decide upon the amount of structure and formality for their data governance design.', 'Tallon et al.', 'Future research should determine which antecedents are likely to dominate if organizations concurrently possess both enabling and inhibiting antecedents.', 'Another relevant but under-researched area comprises the eﬀec- tiveness of data governance.', 'Current research only provides brief evi- dence of the intermediate performance eﬀects and the ways how to measure those eﬀects (Kamioka et al., 2016, p.', 'Mikalef et al., 2018, p.', 'Otto, 2013, p.', 'Tallon et al., 2014, p.', 'On the other hand, organizations still struggle to provide a compelling use case that links data governance to value generation (Nielsen et al., 2018, p.', 'To fully comprehend data governance, we need to understand how inter- mediate performance eﬀects impact strategic business outcomes such as revenue growth, cost reduction, and regulatory compliance.', 'Future research should conduct a richer analysis of intermediate-level perfor- mance eﬀects and their impact on strategic business outcomes.', 'This could be achieved by identifying the causal links between intermediate- level and ﬁrm-level performance eﬀects.', 'The ﬁndings could help or- ganizations to quantify the beneﬁts of data governance and to derive the business case.', 'Furthermore, we presently cannot deﬁne the point beyond which users can feel constrained by data governance.', 'If orga- nizations use too bureaucratic, complex, and restrictive data govern- ance mechanisms, this ‘over-governance’ could lead to a performance decrease by limiting data-led innovations and motivating users to by- pass policies and take unnecessary risks with their data.', 'Tallon et al.', 'Future research should conduct a richer analysis of this curvilinear relationship and the inﬂection point, which determines the optimal data governance design.', 'In doing so, researchers should consider the inﬂuence of antecedents as well as the organizational, data, and domain scope.', 'Generalizability and replicability', 'In addition to the research areas described above, the use of further research methods could unveil new ﬁndings.', 'Prior research mainly conducted single and multiple case studies.', 'This may pose limitations in making controlled observations and deductions as well as limitations concerning the replicability and generalizability of the ﬁndings (Lee, 1989, p.', 'Tallon et al., 2014, p.', 'Transforming the propositions developed in the case studies into testable hypotheses could lay the foundation for further quantitative research (Otto, 2011b, p.', 'Re- searchers should aim at substantiating the propositions on data gov- ernance through quantitative empirical studies on a larger and more representative sample of companies (e.g., Otto, 2011b, p.', 'Tallon et al., 2014, p.', 'Weber et al., 2009, p.', 'In addition, researchers should broaden the sample of study participants.', 'Prior case studies selected primarily IT and data management executives as interview partners (Neﬀ et al., 2013, p.', 'Otto, 2011b, p.', 'Tallon et al., 2014, p.', 'Weber et al., 2009, p.', 'Future research should include ad- ditional stakeholders such as the legal counsel, data architects, appli- cation and process owners, and data stewards.', 'In doing so, researchers could improve internal validity and gain a holistic understanding con- cerning the eﬀectiveness, limitations, and challenges of data govern- ance.', 'Table 4 outlines the research areas for data governance and lists', 'Conclusion', 'In this study, we conducted a structured literature review,

ﬁelds for future re- search: governance mechanisms, the scope of data governance, ante- cedents of data governance, consequences of data governance, and further research strengthening the generalizability and replicability of ﬁndings.', 'From the perspective of the practitioners’ community, the results of the literature review can be considered valuable as the conceptual framework supports practitioners to approach data governance in a structured manner.', 'For example, practitioners could ﬁrst identify the antecedents that aﬀect their organization.', 'Second, they could de- termine the organizational scope, data scope, and domain scope for their data governance design.', 'Data governance with a focus on data quality for master data is likely to be diﬀerent than data governance with a focus on data privacy in the context of big data.', 'Based on those previous two steps, practitioners could choose and customize the set of data governance mechanisms most appropriate for their organization.', 'Reﬂecting on these results will help to avoid approaching the topic prematurely.', 'The conceptual framework also builds the foundation to exploit synergies between decision domains such as data quality and data security.', 'Despite the eﬀorts we have made to present a complete review of data governance literature, the study has its limitations.', 'The major focus of our search process was on the term “data governance” in- cluding synonyms, but less on the broader concept of data management.', 'Future research should review the literature on data management and screen for governance concepts.', 'Moreover, we included the search term “information governance”, as the term is often used interchangeably with the term “data governance”.', 'However,

agenda', 'Data governance refers to the exercise of authority and control over the management of data.', 'The purpose of data governance is to increase the value of data and minimize data-related cost and risk.', 'Despite data governance gaining in importance in recent years, a holistic view on data governance, which could guide both practitioners and researchers, is missing.', 'In this review paper, we aim to close this gap and develop a conceptual framework for data governance, synthesize the literature, and provide a research agenda.', 'We base our work on a structured literature review including 145 research papers and practitioner publications published during 2001-2019.', 'We identify the major building blocks of data governance and decompose them along six dimensions.', 'The paper supports future research on data governance by identifying ﬁve research areas and displaying a total of 15 research questions.', 'Furthermore, the conceptual framework provides an overview of antecedents, scoping parameters, and governance mechanisms to assist practitioners in approaching data governance in a structured manner.', 'Introduction', 'Data governance is the exercise of authority and control over the management of data (DAMA International, 2009, p.', 'It aims at implementing a corporate-wide data agenda (Dyché & Levy, 2006, pp.', 'Carretero, Gualo, Caballero, & Piattini, 2017, p.', 'Otto, 2011a, p.', 'DAMA International, 2009, p.', 'Morabito, 2015, p.', 'While data governance used to be a nice to have in the past, today it is taking on a higher level of importance in enterprises and governmental institutions (Haneem, Kama, Taskin, Pauleen, & Abu Bakar, 2019, pp.', 'This is due to some key trends.', 'The amount of data created annually on the whole planet is expected to increase from 4.4 zettabytes in 2013 to 44 zettabytes in 2020 (IDC, 2014, p.', 'The growing data volumes from diverse sources cause data inconsistencies that need to be identiﬁed and addressed before deci- sions are made based on incorrect data.', 'Companies introduce more self- service reporting and analytics, which create the need for a common understanding of data across the organization.', 'The continuing impact of regulatory requirements such as the General Data Protection Reg- ulation (GDPR) increases the pressure on companies to have a strong handle on what data is stored where, and how the data is being used.', 'Organizations are forced to overcome their challenges regarding in- accurate and incomplete data (Kim & Cho, 2018, p.', 'Morabito,', 'Nielsen, Persson, & Madsen, 2018, p.', 'Khatri & Brown, 2010, p.', 'Despite the growing importance of data governance, the current view on this topic is fragmented.', 'Publications either address data governance with a focus on speciﬁc decision domains such as data quality, data security, and data lifecycle (e.g., Donaldson & Walker, 2004, p.', 'IBM, 2014, p.', 'Otto, 2011c, pp.', 'Tallon, Ramirez,

'We identiﬁed six existing literature reviews related to data governance (Alhassan, Sammon, & Daly, 2016; Alhassan, Sammon, & Daly, 2018; Al-Ruithe, Benkhelifa, & Hameed, 2018; Brous, Janssen, &

'Furthermore, the authors do not describe the antecedents and consequences of data governance, which are necessary to understand the factors that motivate the adoption of diﬀerent data governance practices and the eﬀects of those practices.', 'To overcome these deﬁ- ciencies, we attempt to methodologically analyze and synthesize the literature on data governance and provide a ﬁrm foundation for future research.', 'The following two questions frame our structured literature review of 145 research papers and practitioner publications covering data governance published up to April 2019: What are the building blocks of data governance?', 'Where do we lack in knowledge about data governance?', 'The remainder of this paper is structured as follows.', 'First, we ex- plain our literature search and review method.', 'Second, we describe the conceptual framework of data governance that served as the structure for our review of the state of knowledge.', 'Third, we present the results of the actual review and synthesis of the data governance literature.', 'Fourth, we highlight gaps in our understanding of data governance and propose a research agenda, which contains insightful questions for fu- ture research.', 'Fifth, we conclude with a summary.', 'Literature search and review', 'Similar to other existing literature reviews such as Gong and Janssen (2019) and Senyo, Liu, and Eﬀah (2019), our approach com- prised a structured, topic-centric literature review.', 'We aimed to better describe the domain of data governance and synthesize the relevant knowledge as available in peer-reviewed scientiﬁc literature as well as in selected practitioner publications.', 'In doing so, we followed best practices for literature reviews (Rowe, 2014; vom Brocke et al., 2009; Webster & Watson, 2002; Zorn & Campbell, 2006).', 'Fig.', 'First, we conducted a keyword-based search (Ismagilova, Hughes, Dwivedi, & Raman, 2019, p.', 'Olanrewaju, Hossain, Whiteside, & Mercieca, 2020, p.', 'Rowe, 2014, p.', 'The keyword-based search helped us to avoid bias towards well-known authors or well-cited pa- pers.', 'Through an initial step of probing searches, we identiﬁed “data governance” and “information governance” as search terms.', 'We in- cluded “information governance” as a search term since it is often used interchangeably with “data governance” (e.g. In, Bradley, Bichescu, & Autry, 2019, p.', 'Rasouli, Trienekens et al., 2016, p.', 'Tallon et al., 2014, p.', 'We used the databases in Table 1 that provide access to peer-reviewed IS journals as well as proceedings of leading conferences such as the European Conference on Information Systems and the Americas Conference on Information Systems.', 'We included conference papers since recent research may not yet have been, or may never be, published in journals.', 'We conducted the ﬁnal keyword-based search in April 2019 covering the period from 2002 to 2019.', 'This step resulted in a total of 483 hits across all databases.', 'Next, we conducted a qualitative assessment consisting of two steps.', 'First, we ﬁltered articles', 'We also removed duplicate articles.', 'This step reduced the number of hits to 88.', 'Second, we read those remaining 88 articles and excluded non-scientiﬁc journal articles and papers that referred to data governance only in passing.', 'This left 55 papers to be included in the review.', 'Second, we conducted a backward and forward search of the above 55 papers (vom Brocke et al., 2009, p.', 'We again applied the two-step qualitative assessment described above to exclude non-relevant papers.', 'However, we expanded the assessment to include seminal books on data governance and publications by industry associations such as the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and inter-gov- ernmental organizations such as the Organisation for Economic Co- operation and Development (OECD).', 'We added these publications to obtain a comprehensive view of data governance and reduce systematic biases by simply choosing a set of scientiﬁc journals and conference papers (Boell & Cecez-Kecmanovic, 2015, p.', 'The backward search resulted in 41 relevant papers.', 'For the forward search, we used Google Scholar.', 'We reviewed an additional 44 relevant papers.', 'Third, we considered selected publications not identiﬁed through either the keyword-based search or the backward and forward search.', 'These included one scientiﬁc paper recommended during the review process and four practitioner publications.', 'The latter comprised pub- lications by the European Foundation for Quality Management (EFQM), the Information Systems Audit and Control Association (ISACA), and by leading data governance tooling vendors IBM and Informatica (Peyret & Goetz, 2014, pp.', 'The third step resulted in 5 additional publications.', 'In total, we reviewed 145 publications on data governance.', 'Table 1 summarizes the search process and results.', 'Fig.', 'All relevant publications were categorized according to their nature (scientiﬁc or practice-oriented) and format (papers in journals and conference proceedings, theses, publications by industry associations and inter-governmental organizations, publications by software ven- dors and consultants, books).', 'Table 2 presents an overview of the publications within the scope of this literature review.', 'Data governance deﬁnition and framework', 'As proposed by Zorn and Campbell (2006, p.', 'Furthermore, we present a conceptual framework for data governance to structure the review.', 'The conceptual framework builds on the rich data we have collected during our literature search process.', 'We did not ﬁnd a standard deﬁnition of data governance in scho- larly literature or in the set of practitioner publications.', 'Hence, we analyzed every deﬁnition of data governance in our set of papers and used open coding to ﬁnd common characteristics.', 'The analysis led us to the following deﬁnition of data governance: Data governance spe- ciﬁes a cross-functional framework for managing data as a stra- tegic enterprise asset.', 'In doing so, data governance speciﬁes de- cision rights

(bold text) is our own but corresponds to the char- acterization of data governance in the reviewed literature.', 'Our deﬁni- tion of data governance has six parts.', 'First, data governance is a cross- functional eﬀort.', 'It enables collaboration across functional boundaries and data subject areas.', 'Second, data governance is a framework, which provides structure and formalization for the management of data.', 'Third, data governance focuses on data as a strategic enterprise asset.', 'Data is the representation of facts in diﬀerent formats.', 'Fourth, data governance speciﬁes decision rights and accountabilities for an organiza- tion’s decision-making about its data.', 'It determines what decisions need to be made about data, how these decisions are made, and who in the organization has the rights to make these decisions.', 'Fifth, data gov- ernance develops data policies, standards, and procedures.', 'These artifacts should be consistent with the organization’s strategy and promote de- sirable behavior in the use of data.', 'Finally, data governance monitors compliance.', 'It includes the implementation of controls to ensure that data policies and standards are followed.', 'This deﬁnition also considers the diﬀerentiation between data governance and data management made by several authors.', 'Data governance refers to what decisions must be made and who makes those decisions, whereas data management is about making those decisions as part of the day-to-day execution of data governance policies (Dyché & Levy, 2006, pp.', 'Hagmann, 2013, pp.', 'Khatri & Brown, 2010, p.', 'Otto, 2013, p.', 'Table 3 shows how the characteristics of data governance in our deﬁ- nition correspond to the reviewed set of papers.', 'We performed the analysis for all data governance deﬁnitions in the papers, and the table provides selected excerpts for illustration.', 'We aimed to synthesize the literature according to a conceptual framework that allows us to structure the review of important concepts of data governance.', 'A conceptual framework “explains, either graphi- cally or in narrative form, the main things to be studied – the key factors, constructs or variables – and the presumed relationships among them” (Miles & Huberman, 1994, p.', 'It brings together the diﬀerent currents of thought and helps identify directions for future research (Marshall & Rossman, 2011, p.', 'The process of creating this con- ceptual framework was as follows: We applied open coding analysis techniques suggested by Corbin & Strauss (2015, pp.', 'We used a concept matrix as described by Webster & Watson (2002, p.', 'We then mapped these concepts against ex- isting frameworks and found that the IT governance cube of Tiwana, Konsynski, and Venkatraman (2014) and the framework for data de- cision domains of Khatri and Brown (2010) provided useful starting points for grouping these concepts.', 'We used the dimensions proposed in those frameworks to create our conceptual framework for data gov- ernance.', 'However, we made several changes to the dimensions to suit the needs of our review.', 'Among others, we divided the content di- mension of Tiwana et al.', 'Khatri & Brown.', 'Fig.', 'The conceptual', 'Fig.', 'Governance mechanisms represent the core dimension of the framework and encompass structural, procedural, and relational mechanisms.', 'The organizational scope determines the orga- nizational expansiveness of data governance and roughly corresponds to the unit of analysis.', 'We diﬀerentiate between the intra-organiza- tional and the inter-organizational scope.', 'The data scope pertains to the data asset an organization needs to govern.', 'We distinguish between traditional data and big data.', 'The domain scope covers the data

policies (Randhawa, 2019, p.', 'The second consequence of data governance is the management of data-related risk (e.g., Dreibelbis et al., 2008, pp.', 'Malik, 2013, p.', 'Otto, 2011c, p.', 'Tallon et al., 2014, p.', 'Risks may arise due to non-conformance with information policies or the absence of oversight regarding data quality (Loshin, 2008, pp.', 'Further risks concern security and privacy breaches (Loshin, 2008, pp.', 'Rifaie et al., 2009, p.', 'Data governance reduces these risks by creating risk-mitigating policies and introducing controls for monitoring compliance (Khatri & Brown, 2010, p.', 'Loshin, 2008, p.', 'Thomas, 2006, p.', 'Research agenda and outlook', 'The review above provides a conceptual framework for data gov- ernance and a comprehensive overview of research ﬁndings and in- sights relevant for data governance to date.', 'Deriving from particular aspects of our above analysis, we brieﬂy outline an agenda for future research on data governance.', 'Our research agenda comprises ﬁve major areas: (1) governance mechanisms; (2) scope of data governance; (3) antecedents of data governance; (4) consequences of data governance; and (5) generalizability and replicability of ﬁndings.', 'Governance mechanisms', 'Determining the data owner can be a diﬃcult task (Vilminko- Heikkinen & Pekkola, 2019, p.', 'Current literature does not provide a common understanding of the data owner role.', 'First, we found am- biguous deﬁnitions regarding the ownership and accountability for data.', 'Some deﬁnitions clearly allocate accountability for data to a dedicated data owner role (Otto, 2011c, p.', 'Dreibelbis et al., 2008, p.', 'Dyché & Levy, 2006, pp.', 'NASCIO, 2008, p.', 'Researchers should further analyze in which cases a dedicated data owner role is beneﬁcial.', 'Second, we lack knowledge of how the data owner is identiﬁed.', 'Do organizations de- termine the data owner based on the application, where the data is stored, or based on the process, which uses the data?', 'Vilminko- Heikkinen & Pekkola (2019, pp.', 'Finnish municipality, but the data owner concept and approach remains un- clear during both projects.', 'Future research should further investigate the process of data ownership determination.', 'Third, we know little about the scope of data ownership.', 'For a regulation-driven data gov- ernance program, the scope might be narrowly deﬁned focusing on key data elements, whereas for an analytics-driven program it might be more meaningful to widen the scope to comprise entire data domains.', 'Future research should conduct a richer analysis on how to deﬁne the scope of data ownership, as it might impact the eﬀectiveness of data governance design.', 'The allocation of decision-making authority also requires further research.', 'As part of our review, we identiﬁed basic categories regarding the allocation of decision-making authority, i.e. hierarchical posi- tioning, functional positioning, and the positioning of decision-making authority on a continuum ranging from centralized to decentralized.', 'However, we do not know which allocation of decision-making au- thority is most suitable under which circumstances.', 'In case of func- tional positioning, Otto (2011b, pp.', 'However, this proposition requires substantiation through quantitative empirical studies on a larger and more representative sample of companies.', 'Researchers should analyze whether allocating decision-making authority to a business function is more eﬀective than allocating it to an IT function or a separate data governance organization.', 'Weber et al.', 'However, they do not provide empirical evidence of this contingency approach.', 'Researchers should conduct further studies to analyze under which circumstances a centralized, decentralized, or hybrid allocation of decision-making authority is most suitable.', 'Un- derstanding how to allocate decision-making authority could greatly improve the eﬀectiveness of data governance.', 'Furthermore, data governance is an ongoing program and a con- tinuous improvement process (Cheng et al., 2017, p.', 'DAMA International, 2009, p.', 'New internal data needs and changing ex- ternal demands such as legal and regulatory requirements force data governance to evolve and adapt (Tallon et al., 2014, p.', 'Weber et al., 2009, p.', 'However, most of the reviewed publications take a “one-oﬀ” perspective on data governance and do not reﬂect how data governance arrangements might need to change over time.', 'We identi- ﬁed a few publications which focus on the evolution of speciﬁc data governance concepts such as the evolution of the data governance strategy (Tallon et al., 2013), data ownership (Vilminko-Heikkinen & Pekkola, 2019), and data governance eﬀectiveness (Otto, 2013).', 'Future research should build on these results and conduct further qualitative, quantitative, and longitudinal studies to deepen the knowledge about data governance evolution.', 'The ﬁndings could provide a better un- derstanding of which governance mechanisms should be applied during diﬀerent phases of a data governance program.', 'Scope of data governance', 'Data governance for ecosystems of public and private organizations is another promising research area.', 'Firms increasingly collaborate with partnering companies, outsourcing vendors, and cloud service provi- ders to manage parts of the data value chain (Bruhn, 2014, pp.', 'Panian, 2010, p.', 'Research institutions team up and form dis- tributed research networks which allow researchers to use data from multiple institutions (Kim et al., 2014, p.', 'Current research has started investigating data governance for speciﬁc types of inter-orga- nizational settings such as cloud computing (Al-Ruithe, Benkhelifa, & Hameed, 2016), platform ecosystems (Lee et al., 2017), dynamic busi- ness networking (Rasouli, Trienekens et al., 2016), supply chains (In et al., 2019), and inter-organizational data collaborations (van den Broek & van Veenstra, 2015).', 'However, we do not know much about how organizations ensure data ownership and control in inter-organi- zational relationships.', 'Especially the exchange of sensitive data such as personal health information raises new concerns about privacy (Winter & Davidson, 2018, p.', 'Future research should investigate which data governance mechanisms can help organizations to retain control over their data in inter-organizational settings.', 'Researchers should also ex- plore governance practices that support individuals and groups in ef- fectively co-determining how their data is governed and (re)used.', 'For example, additional governance bodies might be required to monitor compliance and balance interests in inter-organizational settings.', 'Fur- thermore, companies need to create a standardized and trustworthy data exchange environment (Cohn, 2015, p.', 'Rasouli, 2016, p.', 'Rasouli, Trienekens et al., 2016, pp.', 'Future research should in- vestigate how meta data and other concepts can be used to facilitate interoperability between organizations and traceability of data prove- nance.', 'Finally, the complexity of ecosystems increases with the number of participating organizations (van den Broek & van Veenstra, 2015, p.', 'Researchers should conduct further qualitative studies to explore the most appropriate governance designs for one-to-one, one-to-many, and', 'R.', 'Abraham, et al.', 'International Journal of Information Management 49 (2019) 424–438', 'Consequences of data governance', 'Data governance for big data has been a speciﬁc focus in research (e.g. Kim & Cho, 2018; Malik, 2013; Winter & Davidson, 2018).', 'As organizations try to integrate and use big data, having an eﬀective data governance design becomes substantive.', 'However, no general data governance approach for big data has been agreed upon.', 'We identiﬁed four major big data challenges and research opportunities regarding data governance.', 'First, data quality for big data needs to be addressed given the incomplete and often uncertain nature of big data (Lemieux, Gormly, & Rowledge, 2014, p.', 'Malik, 2013, p.', 'Data quality issues concerning big data could become an increasing risk, as organi- zations keep on applying data-driven decision-making (Kim & Cho, 2018, p.', 'Morabito, 2015, p.', 'Future research should determine how data quality metrics should be deﬁned for big data and how ac- curate big data needs to be.', 'Second, big data raises concerns regarding privacy infringements (e.g. Tallon, 2013, p.', 'Winter & Davidson, 2018, p.', 'The extent to which organizations can act upon big data insights is still an unresolved issue (Tallon, 2013, p.', 'For example, combining data sources to reveal new patterns could cause un- anticipated exposure of personal habits (IBM, 2014, p.', 'Researchers should explore governance mechanisms that enable innovation through big data analytics with simultaneous consideration of privacy require- ments.', 'This could include policies determining the ethical and per- missible use of big data without violating privacy rights.', 'Third, not all data is equally useful, but have varying degrees of value (Malik, 2013, p.', 'However, the deﬁnition of the intrinsic data value and the methods of how to measure it still prompt questions (Kooper et al., 2011, pp.', 'Malik, 2013, p.', 'Future research should investigate how to quantify the intrinsic data value.', 'The results could help com- panies to adjust data retention policies and determine when to migrate data to low-cost storage tiers and when to delete data.', 'Finally, in- tegrating big data with traditional enterprise data poses challenges (Malik, 2013, pp.', 'Data is often fragmented and stored in in- compatible IT systems (Lemieux et al., 2014, p.', 'Morabito, 2015 p.', 'The reason for these data silos is often a lack of cross-organiza- tional collaboration (Nielsen et al., 2018, p.', 'Researchers should investigate how governance mechanisms can be applied to foster cross- organizational collaboration to deconstruct data silos.', 'Antecedents of data governance', 'We found that organizations need to design data governance con- sidering contextual factors.', 'Research informing these design decisions will be useful as it helps organizations to tailor data governance ac- cording to their speciﬁc environment and needs.', 'Although these ante- cedents have received some attention (Tallon et al., 2014; Weber et al., 2009), we do not know much about their relative importance, their interrelations, and their causal chains.', 'We found in the review that many data governance approaches do not consider contextual factors, which seems reductionist and unrealistic.', 'For future research, rather than ignoring the context, it would be useful if researchers analyzed contextual factors and their impact on data governance design and implementation.', 'This includes the investigation of additional ante- cedents such as speciﬁc industries, ﬁrm size, and corporate culture (Begg & Caira, 2012, p.', 'Cave, 2017, pp.', 'NASCIO, 2008, p.', 'Neﬀ et al., 2013, p.', 'Yu & Foster, 2017, p.', 'Based on those ﬁnd- ings, organizations could decide upon the amount of structure and formality for their data governance design.', 'Tallon et al.', 'Future research should determine which antecedents are likely to dominate if organizations concurrently possess both enabling and inhibiting antecedents.', 'Another relevant but under-researched area comprises the eﬀec- tiveness of data governance.', 'Current research only provides brief evi- dence of the intermediate performance eﬀects and the ways how to measure those eﬀects (Kamioka et al., 2016, p.', 'Mikalef et al., 2018, p.', 'Otto, 2013, p.', 'Tallon et al., 2014, p.', 'On the other hand, organizations still struggle to provide a compelling use case that links data governance to value generation (Nielsen et al., 2018, p.', 'To fully comprehend data governance, we need to understand how inter- mediate performance eﬀects impact strategic business outcomes such as revenue growth, cost reduction, and regulatory compliance.', 'Future research should conduct a richer analysis of intermediate-level perfor- mance eﬀects and their impact on strategic business outcomes.', 'This could be achieved by identifying the causal links between intermediate- level and ﬁrm-level performance eﬀects.', 'The ﬁndings could help or- ganizations to quantify the beneﬁts of data governance and to derive the business case.', 'Furthermore, we presently cannot deﬁne the point beyond which users can feel constrained by data governance.', 'If orga- nizations use too bureaucratic, complex, and restrictive data govern- ance mechanisms, this ‘over-governance’ could lead to a performance decrease by limiting data-led innovations and motivating users to by- pass policies and take unnecessary risks with their data.', 'Tallon et al.', 'Future research should conduct a richer analysis of this curvilinear relationship and the inﬂection point, which determines the optimal data governance design.', 'In doing so, researchers should consider the inﬂuence of antecedents as well as the organizational, data, and domain scope.', 'Generalizability and replicability', 'In addition to the research areas described above, the use of further research methods could unveil new ﬁndings.', 'Prior research mainly conducted single and multiple case studies.', 'This may pose limitations in making controlled observations and deductions as well as limitations concerning the replicability and generalizability of the ﬁndings (Lee, 1989, p.', 'Tallon et al., 2014, p.', 'Transforming the propositions developed in the case studies into testable hypotheses could lay the foundation for further quantitative research (Otto, 2011b, p.', 'Re- searchers should aim at substantiating the propositions on data gov- ernance through quantitative empirical studies on a larger and more representative sample of companies (e.g., Otto, 2011b, p.', 'Tallon et al., 2014, p.', 'Weber et al., 2009, p.', 'In addition, researchers should broaden the sample of study participants.', 'Prior case studies selected primarily IT and data management executives as interview partners (Neﬀ et al., 2013, p.', 'Otto, 2011b, p.', 'Tallon et al., 2014, p.', 'Weber et al., 2009, p.', 'Future research should include ad- ditional stakeholders such as the legal counsel, data architects, appli- cation and process owners, and data stewards.', 'In doing so, researchers could improve internal validity and gain a holistic understanding con- cerning the eﬀectiveness, limitations, and challenges of data govern- ance.', 'Table 4 outlines the research areas for data governance and lists', 'Conclusion', 'In this study, we conducted a structured literature review, provided an overview of the state-of-the-art of data governance, and identiﬁed a research agenda.', 'Two research questions framed our literature review: What are the building blocks of data

mechanisms, organizational scope, data scope, domain scope, antecedents, and consequences of data governance.', 'We', 'R.', 'Abraham, et al.', 'Table 4 Research agenda for data governance.',

ﬁelds for future re- search: governance mechanisms, the scope of data governance, ante- cedents of data governance, consequences of data governance, and further research strengthening the generalizability and replicability of ﬁndings.', 'From the perspective of the practitioners’ community, the results of the literature review can be considered valuable as the conceptual framework supports practitioners to approach data governance in a structured manner.', 'For example, practitioners could ﬁrst identify the antecedents that aﬀect their organization.', 'Second, they could de- termine the organizational scope, data scope, and domain scope for their data governance design.', 'Data governance with a focus on data quality for master data is likely to be diﬀerent than data governance with a focus on data privacy in the context of big data.', 'Based on those previous two steps, practitioners could choose and customize the set of data governance mechanisms most appropriate for their organization.', 'Reﬂecting on these results will help to avoid approaching the topic prematurely.', 'The conceptual framework also builds the foundation to exploit synergies between decision domains such as data quality and data security.', 'Despite the eﬀorts we have made to present a complete review of data governance literature, the study has its limitations.', 'The major focus of our search process was on the term “data governance” in- cluding synonyms, but less on the broader concept of data management.', 'Future research should review the literature on data management and screen for governance concepts.', 'Moreover, we included the search term “information governance”, as the term is often used interchangeably with the term “data governance”.', 'However, we identiﬁed few pub- lications that diﬀerentiate between both terms (de Abreu Faria et al., 2013, p.', 'Jim & Chang, 2018, p.', 'Kooper et al., 2011, p.', 'Future research should further investigate the usage of these terms.', 'Due to lack of access, we were not able to use certain scientiﬁc databases such as Scopus and Web of Science.', 'Though we are convinced that we have compiled most of the studies carried out on this topic, future', 'The study did not validate the practical applicability of the conceptual framework.', 'First, we did not distinguish, which ﬁndings describe norms of data governance and which describe the actual practice.', 'Future re- search should conduct expert interviews or case studies to ascertain which data governance concepts are applied in practice.', 'Second, our conceptual framework does not provide the information on which data governance mechanisms to choose for a given set of antecedents and a given organizational, data, and domain scope.', 'Researchers should conduct a quantitative study to identify the correlations between antecedents, the scoping parameters, and data governance mechanisms.', 'This could provide further insights on how to conﬁgure data govern- ance in a speciﬁc environment.', 'With our research agenda, we support the call from Tiwana et al.', 'We provided a comprehensive overview of the topic that is valuable for both re- searchers and practitioners in the ﬁeld of data governance.', 'We hope that our work facilitates future research on data governance by pro- viding a conceptual foundation.', 'Funding', 'This

beyond transactions.', 'Business decisions and processes started to be driven increasingly by data and data analysis.', 'Further invest- ment in data management was the approach taken to tackle the increasing volume, velocity, and variety of data, such as complex data repositories, data warehouses, enterprise resource planning (ERP), and customer relationship management (CRM) [4].', 'Data links became very complex and shared among multiple systems, and the need for providing a single point of reference in order to simplify daily functions became crucial, which gave birth to the master data

structure and the wider support of the organiza- tion.', 'Despite its recognized high importance, data governance is still an under-researched area and less practiced in industry [4, 7].', 'Researcher differ in defining data governance, the Data Governance Institute (DGI) defines it as follows Bdata gover- nance is a system of decision rights and accountabilities for information-related processes, executed according to agreed- upon models which describe who can take what actions with what information, and when, under what circumstances, using what methods^ [8].', 'A recent development in technology is the emergence of cloud computing.', 'The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) defined cloud computing as Ba model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network ac- cess to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort

essential charac- teristics of cloud computing model include on-demand self- service, broad network access, resource pooling, rapid elastic- ity, and measured service [11].', 'The cloud deployment models are private, public, hybrid, and community model [12, 13].', 'In addition, cloud computing includes three service delivery models which are software as a service (SaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), and infrastructure as a service (IaaS) [14].', 'Cloud computing offers potential benefits to public and private organizations by making information technology (IT) services available as a commodity [15, 16].', 'The general claimed ben- efits of cloud computing include cost efficiency, unlimited storage, backup and recovery, automatic software integration, easy access to information, quick deployment, easier scale of services, and delivery of new services [17].', 'Furthermore, other benefits include optimized server utilization, dynamic scalabil- ity, and minimized life cycle

extracting their data from the cloud [19].', 'Cloud consumers can also suffer from operational and regulatory challenges, as organizations transfer their data to third parties for storage and processing [6].', 'Also, it may be difficult for the consumers to check the data handling practices of the cloud provider or any of the other involved actors [15, 20, 21].', 'The cloud com- puting model is expected to be a highly disruptive technology, and the adoption of its services will, therefore, require an even more rigorous data governance strategies and programs, which can be more complex, but necessary.', 'The authors’ general observation reveals that the area of data governance in general is under researched and not widely practiced by organizations, let alone when it is concerned with cloud computing, where research is really in its infancy and far from reaching maturity.', 'This forms the main motivation behind this paper, which attempts to provide the readers with a comprehensive review on data governance in both non-cloud and cloud computing.', 'The contribution of this paper is unprec- edented, where a systematic literature review (SLR) principles are followed meticulously, to ensure all quality attributes of the review, including reliability, suitability, relevance, and completeness.', 'The mapping study also delivers the first sys- tematic summary of cloud data governance research.', 'The cat- egorization of available publications helps researchers gain an overview of the state-of-the-art of research and current re- search gaps for

been published from major companies and consultancies, IBM, Microsoft, Gartner, and Cloud Security Alliance.', 'In systematic literature review (SLR), the researcher needs to explicitly define the search boundaries, in order to ensure the quality of the review with a focused scope; these are re- ferred to including and exclusion criteria as defined in [22].', 'Table 2 defines these criteria applied in the search protocol.', 'According to [25], the main purpose of study selection is to', 'Selection criteria are based on inclusion and exclusion criteria.', 'The term Bdata governance^ was used in this search, but we also tried a combination of keywords in order to test for synonyms used in the literature and to cover all relevant publications.', 'The following search strings were also

will clarify what data gover- nance and hence help eliminate all irrelevant literature, which might be confused with the concept of data governance.', 'For instance, often researchers and practitioners confuse between data governance and data management.', 'The definition of data management provided by the Data Management Association (DAMA) is as follows: Bdata management is the development, execution, and supervision of plans, policies, programs, and practices that control, protect, deliver, and enhance the value of data and information assets^.', 'Data management in general focuses on the defining of the data element, how it is stored, structured, and moved.', 'DAMA defines data governance as Bthe exercise of authority, control, and shared decision- making (planning, monitoring, and enforcement) over the management of data assets^.', 'Data governance is therefore, high-level planning and control over data management [26].', 'Authors of [27] have also argued that data governance is dif- ferent from data management; that data governance comple- ments data management, but does not replace it.', 'Authors of [28] defined data governance as Ba system of decision rights and accountabilities for information-related processes, execut- ed according to agreed-upon models which describe who can take what actions with what information, and when, under what circumstances, using what methods^.', 'While authors of [6] defined data governance as Bspecifies the framework for decision rights and accountabilities to encourage desirable be- havior in the use of

organizational factors include clear definition of roles and responsibilities, business and IT involvement,', 'The technological factors include the automation of data inte- gration life cycle to deliver on the goals of data governance.', 'Cheong and Chang [93] have also identified some critical data governance success factors to include strategic accountability, standards, managerial blind spots, embracing complexities of data, cross divisional issue, data quality metrics, partnership with other companies, strategic points of control, training and awareness of data stakeholders, and compliance monitoring.', 'Successful data governance, therefore, requires bringing to- gether a diverse expertise from various departments into any one organization to achieve consistency, transparency, and repeatability of processes that enable best data-related deci- sion making [94] and establish accountabilities, maintain scope and focus, define measurable successes [4], support

process of only 52 articles we found.', 'State-of-the-art of data governance for cloud and non-cloud have been discussed in this paper.', 'We were able to highlight some of the challenges for implementing data governance in cloud computing, and we highlight the key dimensions of data governance.', 'We believe this paper will be useful for the researcher who is interested on data governance, and it provides direction for the researcher in the future.', 'However, future work will focus on developing a holistic framework for cloud data governance strategy, which highlights the main pillars, processes, and attributes to design more specific data governance programs.', 'In addition, the CSFs and barriers to implement data governance for non- cloud and cloud computing environments will be considered in the future work.', 'References', 'Nfuka E, Rusu L (2010) Critical Success Factors for E f f e c t i v e I T G o v e r n a n c e i n t h e P u b l i c S e c t o r

involved in Data Governance, a number of recommendations can also be found in literature.', 'Roles most frequently mentioned are data stewards, data own- ers, and data committees.', 'Data stewards

some researchers, as it might suggest that data “is owned” by a certain corpo- rate function or division, which would contradict the approach to view data as company assets (i.e. assets that are owned by the enterprise as a whole).', 'Still, the term data owner has established itself among practitioners.', 'The data owner role regarding supplier master data, for exam- ple, is often allocated to the head of cen- tral procurement.', 'A data committee', 'Data Gov- ernance.', 'It speciﬁes the principles for using the data throughout the entire enterprise, and it matches the different interests and demands of the functional departments and business divisions (rep- resented by the data owners) on the one side and the data management function (represented by the data stewards) on the other side

re- sponsibility.', 'For example, the decision- making authority regarding the data ar- chitecture could be assigned to the data', 'When as- signing roles to decision areas, the ba- sic principle of

Finally, essential data governance principles are outlined in Section 5.', 'Data governance', 'Data governance has been given scant attention and is often over- looked by organizations in their efforts to realize BDAS and create Fair, Accountable and Transparent (FAT) algorithms.', 'Often the focus is on experimenting with AI, but acquiring and preparing data for AI, which often consumes most of the time, is given less consideration.', 'However, the ubiquitous nature of data, when using large volumes and varieties of data from multiple sources, the uncertain impact of data flows on data quality, and lack of awareness about the importance of data quality, all complicate governance.', 'Data quality consists of many di- mensions including accuracy, timeliness, completeness, consistency,', 'Strong, Lee, & Wang, 1997).', 'Data collection and sharing has become easier over the last decade, partly due to interoperability solutions.', 'However, interoperability also facilitates inaccurate data to flow smoothly across systems and con- taminate them in an exponential manner (Dasu, 2013).', 'The same technological advancements, with data collected from heterogeneous resources, stored in various ways and having different qualities, make data types and structures increasingly complex (Dasu, 2013).', 'Besides, vast volumes of data complicate entity resolution – identifying the same real-world entity like e.g. a person, within a single database (de-du- plication) or in multiple databases (record linkage).', 'Furthermore, even if accurate data is stored, data glitches may produce inaccuracies over time.', 'These glitches originate from changes in the environment, which produce discrepancies between the reality and how data capture this reality, e.g. after the change of the residential address, the old address remains on record.', 'Hence, high levels of information quality are hard to achieve.', 'While most government organizations recognize today that data is crucial, the creation of a culture which treats data as an asset and which helps public servants make data-driven decisions is challenging (Benfeldt et al., 2020).', 'While data governance should help lower the cost of data management and create value from data, data is often fragmented over many organizations which implement different data policies.', 'This can result in unclear responsibility, diffused account- ability, and unknown data quality, which, in turn, might undermine the fitness-to-use of such data within BDAS.', 'BDAS, and the AI algorithms embedded in them, are increasingly used to make consequential decisions.', 'However, such decisions may be incorrect, and responsibility for this may be challenging to determine.', 'Low data quality and unclear dependencies between data and algo- rithms can easily bias or skew the outcomes of the AI algorithms.', 'Shared roles and joint operations performed among departments and organizations may dilute responsibilities.', 'For instance, who is re- sponsible when an algorithm provides wrong outputs due to anomalies in data collected through multiple sensors?', 'The causal relationship between an event and a system failure might be difficult to establish without proper data governance.', 'While applying BDAS in consequential decision-making is condi- tional on data quality, perfect data quality does not exist.', 'On one side, data providers can argue that data quality never reaches 100% and even include such arguments in data usage agreements.', 'On another, the BDAS operators might blame poor data quality for arriving at wrong decisions.', 'This raises the challenge of defining and sharing responsi- bilities between data providers, algorithms provides and BDAS opera- tors as part of data governance, particularly when multiple organiza- tions engage in such governance jointly.', 'Yet limited understanding of what constitutes data governance for BDAS in general and AI-based BDAS in particular, even less how to carry out system- level data governance, between different organizations.', 'Terminologically, the terms governing, governance and manage- ment are all different.', 'Governance is the organizing logic through which the management of data – collection, storage, processing, using, sharing and destroying – takes place.', 'Governing comprises activities conducted to create and execute this logic.', 'These include not only the management of data but also decisions made over data: who can make such decisions and therefore influence how data is accessed, controlled, used and benefited from (Khatri & Brown, 2010), and how data can be used (or potentially used) and by whom.', 'The scope of usage decisions is essential as they determine what is expected from data governance.', 'In any case, designing data governance requires stepping back from the daily routine (Khatri & Brown, 2010).', 'Conceptually, it transpires that data governance is the exercise of authority and control over the management of data (Brackett & Earley, 2009, p.', 'It can also be viewed as “the exercise of decision making and authority for data-related matters.', 'It is a system of decision rights', 'M.', 'Janssen, et al.', 'Government Information Quarterly 37 (2020) 101493', 'Plotkin, 2013, pp.', 'Thus the goals of data governance are ensuring the quality and proper use of data, meeting compliance requirements, and helping utilize data to create public value.', 'Fulfilling these goals requires mechanisms for personal data protection, security, non-discrimination and equal treatment; covering the entire life-cycle from creating, to processing and sharing, to de- stroying data; and addressing technical, institutional and social im- plications of data sharing.', 'Hence, we define data governance as orga- nizations and their personnel defining, applying and monitoring the patterns of rules and authorities for directing the proper functioning of, and ensuring the accountability for, the entire life-cycle of data and algorithms within and across organizations.', 'Structurally, data governance is exercised through policies, centives and sanctions, as needed to create an organizational culture where data is treated as an asset, and behaviour that supports or vio- lates this treatment is rewarded or sanctioned respectively.', 'Data gov- ernance includes: standardizing data – creating metadata to be able to integrate datasets and ensure the same interpretation of data; allocating relevant procedures and decision authorities to ensure data stewardship and data quality; monitoring data usage, e.g. ensuring risk assessment before using data to carry out consequential decisions; and monitoring such systems as part of the data life-cycle.', 'Data governance approaches', 'A common challenge with data governance is that the data flow and logic may not follow the structure of an organization.', 'The mismatch between organizational structure and data usage can easily result in data silos, duplications, unclear responsibilities, and missing control of data over its entire life-cycle.', 'This is particularly the case for BDAS, which are typically crossing departmental boundaries, not bound to any single function or process, and have to deal with data originating in multiple departmental silos.', 'Numerous challenges are arising in this scenario.', 'There might be a lack of established mechanisms for data governance for dealing with BDAS while involving various organiza- tions.', 'Another is ad-hoc handling of data without procedures and pro- cesses and secure data infrastructure, which might easily result in in- dividual data items being accessible to non-authorized persons.', 'Given such challenges, the choice of the data governance approach is critical, albeit this choice is not always clear or even explicit (Koltay, 2016).', 'Three approaches to data governance are planning and control, organizational, and risk-based.', 'These approaches are not mutually ex- clusive and can be used to complement each other.', 'The three ap- proaches are depicted in Fig.', 'While they are typically applied within organizations, they can be also used between', 'Risk-assement, defining responsibilities, and joint plan- ning and control can be done between organizations, but require the establishment of trusted frameworks.', 'The planning and control approach, often used by IT-governance frameworks (De Haes, Van Grembergen, & Debreceny, 2013), is based on the annual cycle of planning and control.', 'In each cycle, objectives are set, budgets are allocated, and projects are defined, implemented, monitored and evaluated.', 'Budgets and other resources are allocated to projects and departments for executing activities, subject to set prio- rities.', 'In turn, projects and departments must compete.', 'Projects are evaluated on their performance and close alignment between business and technology goals.', 'Planning can initiate infrastructure projects aimed at, for example, improving data quality or exploring the potential and risks of AI-based BDAS in various application areas.', 'In this ap- proach, data governance is carried out through policies and procedures that are repeatable, verifiable and auditable.', 'The approach is often criticized for not easily adapting to change (Janssen & van der Voort, 2016).', 'However, continuous monitoring can help adjust project plans and resource allocations on an ongoing basis.', 'The organizational approach to data governance emphasizes struc- ture, responsibility, accountability and reporting (Mullon & Ngoepe, 2019).', 'This approach, using the principle of top-level design, sets up organizational structures for data governance, and treats data govern- ance as a defining authority (Mullon & Ngoepe, 2019).', 'Consistent with this principle, the approach recommends setting up decision-making structures in the areas of data, AI, privacy or ethics, such as Chief Data Officers (CDA), Chief AI Officers (CAIO), Chief Privacy Officers (CPO) or Chief Ethics Officers (CEO).', 'Within such structures, it also includes the responsibility for data stewardship (Rosenbaum, 2010).', 'With the advent of GDPR and AI, the risk-based approach has gained attention as a way to identify risks of BDAS and introduce appropriate governance mechanisms to address them (Ladley, 2019).', 'This approach is often advocated as a foundation for data governance (Rothstein, Borraz, & Huber, 2013) and an effective solution to AI-specific risks such as data or algorithmic errors, data or algorithmic bias, or even data-embedded discrimination (Janssen & Kuk, 2016).', 'These problems arise due to, in large part, sensitive attributes embedded in data sets which are used by machine learning algorithms to search for patterns (Beretta et al., 2018).', 'Example risks include missing, stolen, outdated, inaccurate or biased data.', 'Regular assessment is needed to establish such risks and appropriate action undertaken to manage them.', 'Actions can be taken incidentally, preventively, or both, depending on the governance mechanism.', 'For example, each AI project could be subject to a risk audit to anticipate and address the possible undesirable effects of the AI algorithms.', 'These approaches can be all in place and complement each other.', 'Nevertheless, different governance mechanisms should be introduced with care, as too much governance can result in excessive overhead and', 'Fig.', 'Tripartite approaches to data governance.', 'M.', 'Janssen, et al.', 'Government Information Quarterly 37 (2020) 101493', 'Too little governance, however, might result in unclear responsibilities, uncontrolled risks and not taking the right precautions and actions.', 'Data governance for trusted BDAS', 'This section aims to formulate the main proposal of this article: the concept of trusted AI-based BDAS and a framework for data governance for such systems.', 'The proposal consists of three elements: system-level governance model for BDAS (Section 4.1), data stewardship and based registries (Section 4.2), and the trusted data-sharing framework based on self-sovereign identities and data-sharing agreements (Section 4.3).', 'System-level controls for BDAS', 'AI comes with immense opportunities but also with risks.', 'It may violate privacy, discriminate, avoid accountability, manipulate and misinform public opinion, and be used for surveillance.', \"For instance, it can recognize faces in photos and video streams to help determine people's whereabouts and their behaviour patterns.\", 'AI capabilities generate immense powers, which are dangerous if systems are allowed to expand without proper oversight, accountability and governance.', 'Data is the basis for BDAS, but the outcomes of BDAS should be mon- itored as well, as they are part of the data life-cycle.', 'Therefore, the entire BDAS should be subject to effective data governance.', 'Data and algorithms can be opened for inspection, although pri- marily intended for machine processing.', 'Even if presented in formats accessible to people, few will be able to understand them, let alone scrutinize.', 'Lacking opportunities for proper public scrutiny, risk as- sessment, regular audits, sampling protocols, validity and quality checking, clear responsibilities, and other inspection mechanisms are needed.', 'Fig.', 'BDAS.', 'As data and AI are in- trinsically connected, the model considers them together.', 'The input data is shown on the left, the output on the right, and algorithmic', 'The model takes into account how BDAS operate with data.', 'Without this, effective governance is not possible.', 'BDAS enable automatic decision-making within public institutions.', 'However, the decision-making authority is hidden from the user di- rectly affected by the outcomes, public officers become merely media- tors rather than decision-makers, and automated public services be- come “hidden bureaucrat” (Wihlborg, Larsson, & Hedström, 2016).', 'Hence, accountability should be designed at the system level.', 'This system-level accountability design should cover not only the internal working of algorithms, but how their usage is organized, how they are fed with data, how the data is controlled, how the outcomes are checked, and how the entire system is audited.', 'As shown at the top of Fig.', 'Freedom of In- formation (FOI).', 'Within the regulatory context, policies, principles and procedures are formulated.', 'Policies prescribe how users should or should not behave concerning data and algorithms, and specifies the means of rewarding or sanctioning such behaviours.', 'Principles are normative and directive; they determine the organizing logic of data governance.', 'The main principles for data governance in BDAS are summarized in Section 5.', 'Data governance is based on the expectations and values of the society, which is ultimately affected by the outcomes of BDAS.', 'The basis for taking these into account is creating a culture where data is treated as an asset, while regulations and commonly accepted public values are guiding data-based decisions.', 'Furthermore, the professionals involved in gathering and processing data must ad- here to professional norms in their respective areas.', 'These expectations and values are translated in the planning and control, organizational, or risk-based governace approaches, resulting in the assignment of decision-making authority and the establishment of processes and procedures.', 'Procedures include the annual planning and control cycles, the introduction of independent ethics commitees, the regular audits, taking of data samples, etc.', 'Controls and audits should be applied to inputs, processes and outputs in the data usage processes, which all must be monitored using qualitative and quanti- tative measures.', 'Fig.', 'System-level governance model of BDAS.', 'M.', 'Janssen, et al.', 'Government Information Quarterly 37 (2020) 101493', 'The bottom left part of Fig.', 'AI algorithm is fed with training data to learn to make de- cisions.', 'Most BDAS are based on a type of machine learning algorithms that identify patterns in data, which they use for descriptive, predictive or prescriptive goals.', 'The risks of training algorithms using historical data are that mistakes, inconsistencies and bias embedded in such data will be reflected in the working of the algorithms.', 'Another risk area is poor generalization of the algorithms to situations outside the data upon which they were trained.', 'Hence, oversight should cover both data quality issues, including the presence of bias, and the fitness of algo- rithms and the data fed into them to the problems they are asked to address.', 'Part of the learning process is also checking the validity of the results, including the determination of false positives and false nega- tives.', 'Although these controls are needed, AI algorithms are often opaque, controls alone are insufficient, and additional governance mechanisms may be required.', 'AI algorithms and their implementations can range from black-box to white-box approaches.', 'For the sake of accountability and transpar- ency, the causality between inputs and decisions should be explained to guarantee the fairness of the results.', 'While people should decide on the rules to be able to explain the causality between data, rules and deci- sions, AI algorithms can be used to improve upon these rules and derive new ones.', 'These requirements suggest that algorithmic processing should take a white-box rather than a black-box approach.', 'The middle part of Fig.', 'In the ideal scenario, this process should adhere to compliance-by-design, i.e. BDAS should be designed to comply with all relevant norms and regulations.', 'However, this scenario would have to guarantee unambiguous data ownership, monitoring of data sources and data quality, controlled adherence to standards, and compliance with other specific requirements.', 'Various data sources used as inputs should be checked for quality, bias and other properties.', 'As changes to data may easily result in the wrong outcomes produced by the algo- rithms, the closeness of new data to training data should be evaluated.', 'Therefore, the changing pattern principle suggests investigating the reasons for introducing changes, and any time a change in pattern is discovered, the outcomes should be validated again.', 'This can be done using samples or comparing the outcomes with previous results or manual decisions.', 'Once the results are communicated, the persons in- volved should have an opportunity to file appeals.', 'Such appeals can be used to scrutinize and further improve the BDAS.', 'BDAS are often opaque, and their working is difficult to understand.', 'Similarly to opening data to the public for the sake of transparency and accountability, the AI algorithms can be opened as well.', 'While most people will be unable to make much sense of the algorithms, this would allow auditors, experts, scientists, citizen scientists and other profes- sionals, equipped with proper tools, to check the working of the algo- rithms.', 'However, the opening of algorithms should be done with care as it might reveal bugs in the working systems, which could be exploited by hackers.', 'Hence, the model assumes that data, algorithms and pro- cesses will be opened to controlled groups for scrutiny.', 'Data governance contains mechanisms to incentivize correct beha- viours and sanction incorrect ones.', 'Whereas misbehaviour and mistakes can be sanctioned, incentives including monetary rewards could be offered for uncovering errors, discrimination, bias or other undesirable features in data, algorithms acting on such data, and processes gov- erning the use of data and algorithms.', 'Such incentives are used in the bug bounty programmes that encourage people to spot and report back issues with the software.', 'However, incentives cannot replace proper policing by audit organizations.', 'The more controls are embedded in governance processes, the higher auditability and problem detection rates, and the more opportunities for learning and improvement.', 'Creating sound data governance requires a balance between com- plete control, which is unreachable, and lack of control, which is dan- gerous, into the mode of governance that is necessary and feasible.', 'Risk-based approaches to data governance are suited to maximize the', 'Controls can play similar preventive and detective roles, guided by socio-technical arrangements within the organizations concerned.', 'To ensure sound data governance, some organizations appoint Chief Data Officers (CDOs) or Chief Algorithmic Officers (CAOs).', 'In contrast, others keep it within the remit of Chief Information Officers (CIOs), Chief Technology Officers (CTOs) or even Chief Privacy Officers (CPOs).', 'The planning and control approach also engages Ethics Committees and related bodies to decide about the use of BDAS.', 'Indeed, all public servants should be sensitized and trained to take responsi- bility for ensuring data quality and proper data sharing.', 'Data stewardship and base registries', 'The foundation of data governance is responsible data collection.', 'If sensitive data, like gender, race, residential address, health status or political preference is collected, then it can be misused or abused.', 'As data that is not collected cannot be misused or abused, the collection of data should be minimized.', 'Nevertheless, there are numerous situations where sensitive data must be collected and shared for the sake of transparency, fraud detection, service improvements, or better deci- sions.', 'Such data, once collected, must be secured to guard against misuse or abuse.', 'The ownership of data is often challenging to establish, and multiple persons might claim the rights to it.', 'An analogy is the ownership of the electricity used in a household, which could be assigned to the house owner, the person currently renting the house, the utility company that provides the electricity, or the government that taxes electricity usage.', 'Furthermore, in law, tangible goods are more natural to own than in- tangible ones, like data which can be shared without limits.', 'In the case of data, the notion of stewardship is preferred over ownership.', 'It draws attention to the provision of trusted and authentic data, to responsible data use and sharing, and to the presence of multiple stewards taking care of similar data.', 'Data stewardship is a team effort where respon- sibilities and expertise are divided among members, who can manage data on behalf of others.', 'Data stewards should ensure responsible information sharing.', 'Plotkin (2013) view data stewardship as a way to formalize account- abilities for managing information resources on behalf of and in the best interest of others.', 'Dawes (2010) formulated the stewardship and use- fulness principles for information sharing: stewardship should assure data quality, validity and security; manage risks; manage and preserve data; and make public officials and organizations responsible for handling information with care and integrity.', 'Others emphasize that stewards are also responsible for information security (Cuganesan, Hart, & Steele, 2017).', 'The usefulness principle should ensure that data can be used for innovation; in particular for BDAS.', 'Dawes (2010) fur- ther argued that stewardship and usefulness are complementary prin- ciples and should guide information-based transparency.', 'In contrast, achieving both information usefulness and effective stewardship over information can be competing (Cuganesan et al., 2017).', 'The steward- ship principle might deal with information sharing risks by withholding that information and thus reducing transparency and accountability.', 'The other way around, the usefulness principes could result in data protection being violated by data stewards.', 'From an operational perspective, data should be managed by one organization or department and used by other organizations or de- partments.', 'When collecting data, data stewards should follow the principle of collecting data at the source (Hammer, 1990) and separ- ating sensitive and non-sensitive data (Janssen, Matheus, Longo, & Weerakkody, 2017).', 'The data can be stored in a base registry, which according to the European Commission (2017, p.', 'When other organizations spot incorrect data, then they should report', 'M.', 'Janssen, et al.', 'Government Information Quarterly 37 (2020) 101493', 'The steward will investigate the issue with the correctness of data and, if needed, update the data and inform the reporting organization, that subsequently can start using this data.', 'Even if data is pooled and linked at the conceptual level, physical sto- rage and responsibility for data should be distributed to reduce vulner- ability.', 'Pooling and linking should ensure that data is interrelated and can easily be combined, if needed.', 'However, governance mechanisms should ensure that data can only be shared if the right conditions, like authoriza- tion by multiple persons or approval by the data protection officer, are met.', 'When information cannot be shared with another department to avoid violating regulations or due to the conflict of interest, we use the intra- organizational information barrier called the Chinese wall.', 'A leading prin- ciple is to minimize the number of persons having access to data – if somebody does not need to access the data, such access should not be granted.', \"To avoid the situation of a single entity exercising control over data without others' consent, distributed responsibilities and separation of con- cerns make systems less vulnerable.\", 'Data stewardship and base registries provide a foundation for data and information sharing.', 'However, mechanisms are needed to ensure responsible data sharing, allowing data sharing when required, but also blocking data sharing when necessary.', 'For this, trusted data sharing frameworks are required.', 'Trusted data sharing framework', 'BDAS often depend on data sources external to the organization, which can be easily manipulated or misused.', 'Hence, data and algo- rithms should not be indiscriminately shared with every organization, and organizations should not have access to information which they do not need.', 'For a single organization, these types of decisions are made within the framework of data governance.', 'However, as BDAS often depend on data sources that are external to the organization, there is a need to extend such data governance to cover multiple organizations.', 'This extension relies on trusted data sharing frameworks, or trusted frameworks for short, that guide data exchange within and between participating organizations while ensuring compliance with regulations and the realization of public value.', 'Trusted frameworks should ensure that the right data is shared, that such sharing is carried out securely and reliably, and that the sharing complies with the regulations like GDPR (European Parliament and European Council, 2016).', 'Trusted frameworks limit access to data to those who are authorized, and ensure non-repudiation of the data origin.', 'A non-repudiation service provides a recipient with the proof of origin, which constitutes a legally-valid evidence that a particular person or organization provided the data.', 'Trusted frameworks are a standard mechanism for governing relation- ships and are used in payment systems, in domain registration systems, or in mobile networks to provide roaming services.', 'In information sharing, tra- ditional trusted third parties (TTPs) that use certificates to provide non-re- pudiation services, are being replaced with distributed ledger or blockchain technology (DLT) (Dunphy & Petitcolas, 2018; Ølnes, Ubacht, & Janssen, 2017).', 'As DLT ensures decentralized execution, avoiding the creation of a single point of failure or misuse, they are less vulnerable.', 'Nevertheless, such a decentralized information sharing system needs to be guided by proper governance mechanisms.', 'Trusted frameworks need to provide identification, authentication and authorization services.', 'Identification refers to a person or organi- zation claiming to have a particular identity.', 'Authentication makes sure that the identified person or organization are what they claim to be; it verifies the claim made by the identifying party.', 'Authorization happens when a person or an organization has been identified and granted ac- cess to data, specifying what they can do with this data.', 'This also results in non-repudiation, that the data origin cannot be disputed.', 'Increasingly, trusted frameworks which are based on agreements', 'The agreements refer to a collaboration of various public and private parties to share data or provide services on topics, such as identification and authentication, part of the efforts to ensure inter- operability and compliance, for instance with GDPR.', 'A trusted frame- work contains several elements to regulate data sharing or other types of services, which may include:', 'These elements should cover the entire data life cycle and should be adaptable to changing circumstances.', 'For instance, a trusted framework should ensure that personal information is only shared when given consent to do so, that only defined parties can have access to specified data, that a variety of public and private organizations can legitimately gain access to such data, etc.', 'Data sharing should be based on the ‘need to know’ principle.', 'A minimum amount of data should be shared and only for specified purposes.', 'For example, when a service requests information if a person is eligible for voting, her age should not be shared, but only whether or not she is 18.', 'The same applies to other types of information, such as birth certificates, diplomas, social security, tax services and others.', 'Instead of providing detailed personal information, an answer should be submitted to a specific question.', 'This reduces the chances of using the data for unrelated purposes.', 'Critical aspects of data governance are identity and trusted data sharing, which are not part of the standard Internet infrastructure.', 'Therefore organizations collect and store identity information such as name, gender, age, profession and others to be able to identify persons.', 'This results in fragmented data landscape where such information is stored in many places.', 'This raises security risks for identity information to be stolen, privacy risks with handling personal information, and data integrity risks as data might not be consistent with each other and the states of the real world.', 'Therefore, this data should be treated as an asset that can be re-used by other organizations using secure and reli- able storage and sharing services.', 'Organizations or users can control the data.', 'The first situation entails organizations defining base registries using data stewardship.', 'The second involves users exercising Self- Sovereign Identity (SSI).', 'SSI provides control over and ownership of data to citizens, who can give consent to share such data with others.', 'Interoperability is created to be able to share data based on commonly agreed standards specified by the trusted framework.', 'The data-sharing governed by trusted frameworks should adhere to the informing principle.', 'When the government shares data about a par- ticular person or organization, this person or organization should be made aware of this to avoid misuse and verify the correctness of such data.', 'Then, when the data is hacked or shared for illegitimate purposes, this is immediately revelated.', 'Furthermore, access to their own data not only results in transparency but also empowers citizens and organiza- tions to be in control of their data, including data about themselves.', 'However, this also requires agreements to regulate access, openness and inclusion.', 'Essential data governance principles', 'Although the foundation of trustworthy BDAS is sound data gov- ernance, this area is often overlooked.', 'Data governance for BDAS is a', 'M.', 'Janssen, et al.', 'Government Information Quarterly 37 (2020) 101493', 'Table 1

be used to encourage people to spot errors and issues and report them back.', 'When governments share data about a person or an organization, these entities should be informed to ensure transparency and avoid misuse.', 'Separate personal from non-personal data, and sensitive from non-sensitive data (Janssen et al., 2017).', 'Empower citizens and organizations to be in control and check the accuracy of their data.', 'Collect data at the source to ensure its correctness and to know how such data is collected (Hammer, 1990).', 'If a party does not need data, access should not be granted.', 'Distributed systems are less vulnerable and avoid easily combining data without permission.', 'Assign data stewards to formalize accountability for managing information resources while adhering to the principle of the separation of concerns (Dawes, 2010).', 'Responsibilities for data should be distributed in such a way that no single person can misuse or abuse data.', 'Data should be recognized as a valuable asset that can be used by BDAS (Dawes, 2010).', 'BDAS without due attention to data governance is a significant risk.', 'Data governance can be viewed as organizations and their personnel defining, applying and monitoring the patterns of rules and authorities for directing the proper functioning of, and ensuring the accountability for, the entire life-cycle of data and algorithms within and across organizations.', 'Data governance can help mitigate the issues of fairness, dis- crimination, and trust.', 'Available approaches to data governance can be based on clear organizational structures, responsibilities and account- abilities, planning and control cycles, and risks.', 'The latter is particu- larly relevant.', 'BDAS face the risks of violating the privacy, using data for undesired purposes, allowing bias or discrimination in data to in- form algorithmic decisions, making wrong decisions, and so on.', 'Although greater transparency into the inner workings of algorithms is necessary, it is insufficient for effective oversight.', 'For that, system-level governance is needed.', 'Organizations and their personnel need to work in concert to carry out effective data governance.', 'Apart from socio- technical measures focused on controls and safeguards, an organiza- tional culture that promotes awareness and ethical value of data and algorithms is part of data governance.', 'Table 1 provides an overview of the 12 main data governance principles that are discussed in this article.', 'Although these principles might at first appear simple, they are challenging to realize.', 'There are hardly any good practices for successful adoption and application of data governance for BDAS.', 'Scarce research exists about trusted fra- meworks and SSIs, and there is no consensus yet about how they should be realized in BDAS.', 'Adhering to these principles will help improve data governance and contribute to trustworthy BDAS.', 'However, there is a need for technologies like base registries and self-sovereign identities to make trustworthy BDAS work.', 'The realization of data governance in multi-organizational settings will also require the use of trusted data- sharing frameworks to guide inter-organizational data exchange, and ensure compliance with regulations as well as the creation of public value.', \"While the foundation of BDAS data governance is responsible data collection, citizens' control of data, and data stewardship, this new research field has to continue advancing before it creates a solid re- search foundation

dramatically,  playing a critical role in businesses operations (Tallon, Ramirez, & Short, 2013).', 'In particular,  data influence both operational and strategic decisions.', 'How to govern these data has also  become  critical,  for  data  to  be  treated  as  a  valuable  asset  (Khatri  &  Brown,  2010).', 'Data   governance has rapidly gained in popularity (Cheong & Chang, 2007; Khatri & Brown, 2010;  Weber, Otto, & Österle, 2009) and is considered to be an emerging subject in the information  system (IS) field (Hagmann, 2013).', 'Practitioners also consider data governance as a promising  approach for enterprises to improve and maintain the quality and use of their data (Otto,  2011a).', 'It can be argued that data governance, from both the academic and practitioner points  of view, should be a universal approach to data accountability, fitting all data aspects and  needs of an organisation (Weber et al., 2009; Wende, 2007).', 'A survey of 200 organisations  (Pierce,

aims to contribute to the IS community through a categorization of current  academic literature in the domain of data governance, which should assist researchers in  understanding the research that has been published around the activities involved in data  governance.', 'These activities highlight the tasks that need to be performed in order to do  data governance.', 'This paper is organised as follows: section 2 presents an overview of the data governance  literature, section 3 describes the research approach used to conduct the literature review,  including the paper selection strategy and the data analysis techniques applied; and section  4 presents the results of our analysis of data governance activities.', 'We conclude by discussing  the results and addressing the limitations and recommendations for future work in the area.', 'Data governance background', 'Data governance is defined as ‘A companywide framework for assigning decision-related rights  and duties in order to be able to adequately handle data as a company asset’ (Otto, 2011b;  p.', 'The main driver for data governance is considering data as an asset of the firm (Panian,  2010).', 'Horne (1995) connected governance with optimal uses of assets, then treated data  and information as an asset, which drives the importance of the governance of the data  within an organisation.', 'The concept of data as an asset was developed in a report by the  Hawley Committee in 1994, which defined data assets as ‘Data that is or should be docu- mented and that has value or potential value’ (Oppenheim, Stenson, & Wilson, 2003).', 'It can be argued that ‘data governance’ is a new term with novel implications for data as  an asset.', 'However, there are many terms and approaches in the academic literature that  deal with data and information under the IS field, such as total data quality management  (TDQM) (see Wang, 1998).', 'Another approach is data quality management (DQM) (see Wang  &  Strong,  1996),  among  many  more  different  approaches  and  terms  (lucas,  2010;  Otto,  Wende, Schmidt, & Osl, 2007).', 'The main difference between the terms ‘governance’ and ‘management’ is that governance  refers to the decisions that must be made and who makes these decisions in order to ensure  effective management and use of resources, whereas management involves implementing  decisions (fu, Wojak, neagu, Ridley, & Travis, 2011; Khatri & Brown, 2010).', 'Hence, manage- ment is influenced by governance (Otto, 2011c).', 'Therefore, we can distinguish between the  activities for data governance and the activities required for data management.', 'The definition of data governance indicates who holds the decision rights and account- ability  regarding  an  enterprise’s  data  assets.', 'Therefore,  the  decision  domains  should  be  identified in order to assign the right responsibilities and duties.', 'In reviewing the literature  relating  to  data  governance  frameworks,  the  framework  proposed  by  Khatri  and  Brown  (2010) was selected to present the decision domains that should be considered for data  governance.', 'The framework contains five interrelated decision domains: 1) data principles,  2) data quality, 3) metadata, 4) data access, and 5) data life cycle as shown in figure 1.', 'These  five decision domains follow a similar pattern to the IT governance decision domains to  proposed by Weill and Ross (2004).', 'I.', 'AlHASSAn eT Al.', 'Data quality', 'Data principles', 'Metadata', 'Data access', 'Data life cycle', 'Figure 1.', 'Decision domains for data governance (Khatri & Brown, 2010).', 'According to Khatri and Brown (2010), data principles are shown at the top of the frame- work as they are intended to establish the direction for all other decision domains.', 'Hence,  the principles set the boundary requirements for uses of data assets, which addresses the  enterprise’s standards for data quality.', 'The data quality then refines the basis for how data  are interpreted (metadata) as well as accessed (data access) by users.', 'IT infrastructure.', 'The focus of our literature review is to identify the data governance activities reported in ', 'Khatri and Brown (2010) framework.', 'Research approach', 'The purpose of this study is to identify and categorise the literature that explicitly mentions  data governance activities.', 'In order to conduct content analysis on a selection of papers,  our research approach adopted steps proposed by finney and Corbett (2007).', 'These steps  consist of data collection and coding procedures and are explained below.', 'Step 1: Decide the level of analysis', 'This step involves deciding what level of analysis should be conducted.', 'The level of analysis  can be a signal word, a set of words, phrases, or an entire document (finney & Corbett, 2007).', 'The data collection phase  was  initiated  by  collecting  papers  through  searches  of  the  following  databases:  the  AIS  electronic library, CiteSeerX, eBSCO Online, emerald Insight, ScienceDirect, and the ACM  Digital library.', 'These 6 databases cover the majority of IS journals and conferences (Otto,  2011a).', 'Search criteria were established in each database using the advanced search function.', 'The  keyword  search  criterion  of  having ‘data  governance’  or ‘information  governance’  in

considered to be  directly related to the data governance domain or focusing on the study of data governance  activities.', 'Step 2: Decide how many concepts to code for Here, researchers should decide whether to code text using a predefined set of concepts or  develop a list of concepts incrementally during the process of coding (finney & Corbett,  2007).', 'Therefore, all the concepts emerged incrementally  through the processes of open coding.', 'Step 3: Decide whether to code for the existence or frequency of a concept After a certain number of concepts have emerged, researchers should decide whether to  code the concepts for existence or frequency (finney & Corbett, 2007).', 'If the concepts are  coded for existence, this involves listing only the concepts that emerge.', 'However, coding  for frequency makes possible a discussion of saliency and emphasis (finney & Corbett, 2007).', 'Step 4: Decide on how you will distinguish between concepts During this step, researchers should decide whether to code the concepts exactly as they  appear, or if they can be coded in some altered or collapsed form (finney & Corbett, 2007).', 'Corbin and Strauss (1990), whereby concepts that appear to be similar are grouped together  under a higher-order, more abstract concept called a category.', 'I.', 'AlHASSAn eT Al.', 'Step 5: Develop rules for coding your text

applied during the coding procedure:', 'All papers were read the first time in order to code data governance activities.', 'There  should be an imperative verb that indicates that an activity should be taken around  data governance.', 'All the concepts that emerged from the papers were compared to identify similarities ', 'Once all the papers were coded, the researchers examined the categories that emerged  and their properties within the actual text in order to ensure that they reflected the  meaning of the actual text.', 'Step 6: Decide what to do with ‘irrelevant’ information This stage involved determining what to do with information in the text that was not coded  (finney & Corbett, 2007).', 'Carley (1993) suggested that deleting irrelevant information can  facilitate  content  analysis  procedures  by  generating  simplified  text.', 'In  this  research,  the  remaining 59 papers received a more in-depth review in order to identify which of the papers  explicitly mention data governance activities.', 'Of the 59 papers, only 31 explicitly mention  the required or recommended data governance activities.', 'These activities are the conditions  or things that need to be performed in order to be considered as doing data governance.', 'In order to be coded as concepts, the sentence had to contain an action (imperative verb)  such as, ‘define’, ‘establish’, ‘manage’ and ‘create’.', 'Step 7: Coding the text The coding procedure should start following the decision related to irrelevant information  and  should  follow  the  translation  rules  identified  in  step  5  (finney  &  Corbett,  2007).', 'As  mentioned earlier, this research adopted an open coding analysis technique, which is part  of a grounded theory approach (Corbin & Strauss, 1990).', 'Open coding analysis is widely  applied in conducting content analysis for a set of academic papers (see finney & Corbett,  2007; Goode & Gregor, 2009; Grahlmann, Helms, Hilhorst, Brinkkemper, & van Amerongen,  2012) and is described as ‘the process of breaking down, examining, comparing, conceptual- ising, and categorising data’ (Corbin & Strauss, 1990, p.', 'Open coding is a process that aims to identify the concepts or key ideas that may be  hidden within data and are likely to be related to a phenomenon of interest (Bhattacherjee,  2012).', 'Concepts and categories are generated in the open coding stage (Glaser, 1992) and,  when the categories are developed, their properties and the dimensions of the properties  are identified (Corbin & Strauss, 1990).', 'Table 3 shows the terms that are involved in open  coding relevant to this study as defined by Corbin and Strauss (1990).', 'This is followed by a  description of how open coding is operationalized.', 'There are two analytical procedures that used to achieve the goal of open coding (Corbin  & Strauss, 1990; Glaser,1992): the first is the ‘making of comparisons’ and the second is the  ‘asking of questions’.', 'The ‘making of comparisons’ procedure concerns comparing each con- cept  with  the  others  for  similarities  and  differences.', 'Then,  as  Corbin  and  Strauss  (2008)  argued, concepts that are found to be conceptually similar are grouped together under a ', 'JOuRnAl Of DeCISIOn SYSTeMS ', 'Table 3.', 'Definitions of the terms that are included in open coding (adapted from corbin & strauss, 1990,  p.', 'Term', 'Properties', 'Definition', 'However,  each  concept  has  the  potential  to  bring  out  different aspects of the same phenomenon based on the proposed analytical procedures.', 'This type of comparison allows the researcher to differentiate categories from each other  and identify the properties and dimensions of each category (Corbin & Strauss, 2008; Glaser,  1992).', 'The second procedure for open coding involves asking questions, and refers to analysis  of the emerged concepts that are conducted to establish what category, or property of a  category, a concept describes (Glaser, 1992).', 'This step requires close examination of the data  through line-by-line coding, which forces the analyst to verify and saturate categories, thus  minimising  the  possibility  of  missing  an  important  category  (Glaser  &  Holton,  2004).', 'Application of these two procedures allows the analyst to conceptualise the data and cate- gorise them according to the specific needs of the intended investigation.', 'Step 8: Analysing the results After  coding  the  data,  researchers  should  decide  how  to  review  and  present  the  results  (finney & Corbett, 2007).', 'Data governance activities analysis', 'A total of 59 articles were reviewed, 31 of which explicitly mention data governance activities.', 'The 31 papers were classified by paper publication type, either a journal paper or conference  proceedings papers, and are listed in Table 4.', 'While reviewing and applying the open coding analysis procedure to the 31 selected  papers, an MS excel spreadsheet was developed.', 'The spreadsheet was constructed to include  reference to each open coding stage, including referencing the original text using Mendeley,  a document management application.', 'The open coding analysis procedure was conducted in an iterative manner (as described  in step 7), starting with reading each paper and searching for any action (imperative verbs)  (see step 6).', 'These concepts were then compared for similarities and differences in order for  them to be categorised in higher abstracted categories which are considered to be data  governance activities.', 'In maintaining the meaning of the categories, it was decided that  each of the categories would consist of the following three constructs: 1) action, 2) area of  governance, and 3) the decision domain.',

formal data governance pro- gramme is to determine a Data Governance structure’, in which the verb ‘determine’ can be  interpreted as ‘define’.', 'Another example comes from Weber et al.', 'It establishes  organisation wide guidelines and standards’, in which the verb ‘establish’ can be deemed to  mean ‘define’.', 'However,  an  interpretation  of  these  actions  relies  upon  the  context  itself.', 'Therefore, each imperative verb could be interpreted as one of the three actions in one case  and to another action in others, such as the verb ‘develop’ in some contexts means to ‘define’

domain, and in some instances all the five decision domains.', 'The  illustrative  example  below  shows  how  the  concepts  were  placed  into  a  category  which was considered to be a data

tioned with different actions or associated with another decision domain.', 'Discussion', 'Our analysis shows that the highest frequency count for the ‘areas of data governance’ is  against the ‘define’ action, specifically, definitions of the data roles and responsibilities, data  policies, data processes and procedures, and data standards.', 'The definition of the data quality  decision domain is also the highest frequency count.', 'This is not surprising as data governance  is often cited as the key aspect of data governance.', 'In contrast, ‘metadata’ has the lowest  frequency count which suggests that a ‘how data is interpreted’ mindset has not received  as much coverage in the academic literature to date.', 'Our analysis also points to a low frequency for ‘implement’ and ‘monitor’ actions this could  indicate a lack of maturity around data governance in practice which penetrates through to  our research activities to date, where the majority of the papers are focusing only on the  ‘define’ action of the data governance areas.', 'Although a ‘define’ action can be considered as  a primary action of data governance areas, ‘implement’ and ‘monitor’ should also play an  important role in data governance.', 'In  addition,  defining  data  technologies  as  an  activity  for  doing  data  governance  has  received an acceptable level of attention specifically for the data life cycle decision domain.', 'However, none of the papers considers monitoring data technologies, which, from our point  of view, is a shortcoming in the research, as it is critical to monitor the activities related to  data technologies in order to manage a data governance programme successfully.', 'I.', 'AlHASSAn eT Al.', 'Table 7.', 'Decision domains\\xa0', 'Actions', 'Define', 'Area of

future work', 'Research in the data governance domain is growing in IS, as is the need for research in this  area as more organisations consider data as a valuable asset.', 'A review of the data governance  literature shows that there is a lack of research that explicitly studies activities for governing  data.', 'Khatri & Brown, 2010; Otto, 2011b; Tallon et al., 2013).', 'These studies

activities.', 'JOuRnAl Of DeCISIOn SYSTeMS ', 'Corbett (2007), the selection process yielded 230 papers that were subject to selection  and exclusion criteria, which led to the exclusion of 171.',

governance activities mentioned in these papers.', 'This research has two key limitations.', 'Institutions  such  as  DAMA  and The  Data Warehousing  Institute  (TDWI)  may   provide further insight into data governance programmes from a practitioner perspective,  and future research may highlight differences in theory and practice (DAMA International,  2009).', 'Secondly, the research presented in this paper concluded with a frequency count of  data governance activities.', 'There was no detailed description for each of the 110 activities  identified in this paper due to page length limitations.', 'The results also, as discussed earlier, reflect the lack of research in the ‘imple- ment’ and ‘monitor’ actions of the different data governance areas.', 'Therefore, is it suggested  that  researchers  in  the  domain  of  data  governance  focus  more  on  the  data  governance  activities related to implementing and monitoring over defining.', 'Disclosure statement',

compounded  by  the  fact  that  (1)  data  is  spread  across  disparate  systems  within  an  organisation,  (2)  data  is  collected,  maintained  and  used  by  various  levels  of  an  organisation,  and  (3)  many  system  development  methodologies do not incorporate data quality assurance.', 'The  abovementioned  data  quality  issues  can  be  addressed  by  having  an

organisation in that it was managing data in a reactive and ad hoc  manner, it has no direct access to its source database, it has difficulty obtaining consensus on data related issues,  its data improvement projects were mostly overrun and over budget; and any attempt to set any standards had not  been  taken  seriously  by  other  groups  of  the  business  and  IT.', 'In  light  of  this,

have a governance structure to endorse and mandate this policy.', 'According to Thomas (2006), this model of informal data governance is called ‘Governance via Stewardship’.', 'However, this form of stewardship is not working for the Data Management team due to the following reasons;  (1) a lack of mandate from the senior executives means that it has no power to act, (2) the lack of mandate means  that sometimes its projects are not given priority as senior executives do not understand the importance of the  projects; and (3) a lack of clear roles and responsibilities, i.e., there no clear definition of data stewards and data  owners.', 'As  highlighted  by  Thomas  (2006),  the  lack  of  authority  and  clear  roles  and  responsibilities  are  common  contributors  to  the  failure  of  ‘Governance  via  Stewardship’.', 'In  this  situation,  there  is  obviously  a  lack  of  connection  between  those  at  the  operational  level  who  knows  the  problem  and  those  who  have  the  power  to  make decision but are removed from the problem.', 'In order to address the issue with decision making authority,  the Data Management team with the executive support of the Asset

The second one is data literacy, about which there is a massive body of literature, among others in the form of review articles (Koltay, 2015a, 2015b; MacMillan, 2014).', 'Data literacy is closely related to research data ser- vices that include research data management (RDM).', 'As the concept of RDSs itself and data literacy edu- cation are still evolving, their relationship to data governance requires examination that may lead to some kind of synthesis.', 'The management of data quality is also inspected in order to determine to what extent it plays the role of an interface between these two constituents.', 'Accordingly, this writing is built on three core terms.', 'Data governance can be defined as the exercise of decision making and authority that comprises a',

'While the various definitions of data literacy will be discussed below, we define it here as the ability to process, sort and filter vast quantities of information, which requires knowing how to search, how to filter and process, to produce and synthesize it (Johnson, 2012).', 'This definition is in accordance with the idea, expressed by Schneider (2013), that the boundaries between information in information literacy and data in data literacy are blurring, because these boundaries never have been rigid.', 'Research data services consist of a wide spectre of informational and technical services that a library offers to researchers in managing the full data life cycle (Tenopir et al., 2012).', 'Research data services and the paradigms of academic library management A better understanding of the academic libraries’ role in the data-intensive environment can be obtained if we place them into the context of academic librarian- ship’s past and present development paradigms, out- lined by Martell (2009).', 'The first paradigm, called the ‘Ownership’ or ‘Collections’ paradigm evolved after World War II and reached its zenith in the 1960s.', 'It was built on the assumption that campus library sys- tems would be able to collect all documents that could adequately satisfy the institutions’ scholarly and teaching needs.', 'Such support allowed for a broad range of interpretations, but it proved to be unsustain- able and was supplanted by the ‘Access’ paradigm that directed more attention to and made use of resource sharing from the late 1970s until the end of the 20th century.', 'Widespread access to digital mate- rial, in particular the availability of electronic full text of serials made ownership in its traditional sense not practical, so the ‘iAccess’ paradigm came into being.', 'More recently, the emergence and growing preva- lence of social media creates an opportunity to add social dimension to iAccess, forging in this way the ‘sAccess’ paradigm.', 'While social media undoubtedly plays a role in Research 2.0, it is often difficult to disentangle the relationship between features that are induced by its presence from the influence of the growing impor- tance of data.', 'Social media influences academic libraries in many ways.', 'It produces enormous quan- tities of (big) data that can be analysed, published and reused mainly by researchers in the social sciences (Boyd and Crawford, 2012).', 'It also changes the ways', 'Nicholas et al, 2014).', 'Therefore, it is a demanding task to define to what extent data-intensive research pertains to iAccess and to sAccess.', 'In any case, both paradigms have influ- ence on it to some degree.', 'Data governance in detail As stated above, data governance is a subject of inter- est for the business sector.', 'Therefore, it is rarely addressed by the LIS literature.', 'A notable exception is the work of Krier and Strasser (2014) that focuses on data management in libraries.', 'A review of definitions of data government by Smith (2007) clearly shows the close ties of DG to the business sector.', 'Besides providing a set of defini- tions that relate it to companies, enterprises and busi- ness, Smith underlines that ‘the process of data governance is to exercise control over the data within a corporate alignment’.', 'It seems clear that the academic sector, librarian- ship, as well as library and information science also should pay attention to DG, albeit it attracted attention mainly in the business sector.', 'Even though rather implicitly, this need is asserted by DosSantos (2015), who points out that the role of the data gov- ernor must shift to be something more akin to a data librarian in order to make data governance the driving force behind business innovation, instead of being an impediment to data.', 'This goal can be attained by deli- vering information technology as a service and by enabling the processes of locating and organizing the best available data.', 'The expression data governance could refer to organizational bodies; rules, policies, standards; deci- sion rights; accountabilities and methods of enforce- ment.', 'DG enables better decision making and protects the needs of stakeholders.', 'It reduces operational fric- tion and encourages the adoption of common approaches to data issues.', 'Data governance also helps build standard, repeatable processes, reduce costs and increase effectiveness through coordination of efforts and by enabling transparency of processes.', 'It is gov- erned by the principles of integrity, transparency and auditability (DGI, 2015a).', 'DG also delineates decision domains, i.e. what decisions must be made to ensure effective manage- ment and use of the organization’s assets.', 'It also defines the locus of accountability for decision mak- ing by defining who is entitled to make decisions in a given organization, and who is held accountable for the decision making related to data assets (Khatri and', 'Koltay: Data governance, data literacy and the management of data quality', 'Brown, 2010; Weill and Ross, 2004).', 'Seiner (2014: 2) adds to this that valid data governance may require identifying ‘people who informally already have a level of accountability for the data they define, pro- duce and use to complete their jobs or functions’.', 'One of the reasons for this is that correct and efficient governance depends as much on technology as on organizational culture, despite the fact that good gov- ernance technology makes data transparent, gives it accountability and helps identify areas where perfor- mance can be improved (ORACLE, 2015).', 'Accountabilities, the main components of which are stewardship and standardization, are defined in a manner that introduces checks and balances between different teams, between those who create and collect information, others who manage it, those who use it, and those who introduce standards and compliance requirements (DGI, 2015b).', 'As stewardship appears in this list and is also pres- ent in several resources related to research data man- agement (Bailey, 2015), and because it is sometimes used interchangeably with DG, some clarification is needed.', 'Data stewardship is concerned with taking care of data assets that do not belong to the stewards themselves, thus data stewards represent the concerns of others, and ensure that data-related work is per- formed according to policies and practices as deter- In contrast, data mined through governance.', 'Rosenbaum, 2010).', 'To be successful, data governance needs to have clear definitions of its objectives, processes and metrics.', 'It has to create its own processes and stan- dards.', 'Besides roles and responsibilities for all data governance roles, communities of practice for gov- ernance, stewardship and information management have to be established.', 'Change management pro- cesses also have to be instituted, and – last but not least – there have to be rewards for good data govern- ance behaviour.', 'Data governance should not be optional, because it contributes to organizational success through repeata- ble and compliant practices.', 'In the sense of managing, monitoring and measuring different aspects of an organization, governance can be related to managing information technology, people and other tangible resources.', 'Data is everywhere, thus DG runs horizon- tally.', 'Definitions of the data and how to use it are part of the data management process, while integrating data into the organization and establishing individuals to oversee the administration of data processes pertain', 'DG also must include metadata, unstructured data, registries, taxonomies and ontolo- gies (Smith, 2007).', 'The traditional principles of DG also apply to big data.', 'From among big data types, data from the Web and from social media, as well as machine-to-machine data deserve special attention.', 'Big data governance is especially important in regard to the acceptable use of data (Soares, 2012).', 'In environments where big data plays a substantial role, one of the most common data integration mistakes is underestimating data govern- ance (ORACLE, 2015).', 'Although big data integration differs from traditional data integration by many fac- tors (Dong and Srivastava, 2013), it demonstrates the complexity and importance of data governance.', 'Data integration itself can be defined as the combination of technical and business processes used to combine data from disparate sources into meaningful and valuable information.', 'It helps to understand, cleanse, monitor, transform and deliver data, thus it supplies trusted data from a variety of sources (IBM, 2016).', 'Data integration solves the problems related to combining data of varied provenance by presenting a unified view of these data (Lenzerini, 2002).', 'As Sarsfield (2009) put it, DG is like an elephant in a dark room.', 'It can be perceived depending on where you touch it.', 'If you touch its tail, it feels like a snake.', 'If you touch one of its legs, it feels like a tree.', 'There- fore, cross-functional perspectives on data govern- ance vary, and we will take this variability into consideration to couple it with data quality and data literacy.', 'In research settings, the stakeholders of DG are researchers, research institutions, funders, publishers and the public at large.', 'A good understanding of data governance also addresses researchers’ fear of lost rights and benefits.', 'Governance structures are needed for managing human subjects-related data as well, because taking care of sensitive information requires not only establishing standards and norms of practice, but fostering culture change towards better data stew- ardship (Hartter et al., 2013).', 'In addition to these functions, data governance in this environment enables proper access and sharing (Riley, 2015), even if data ownership is often ambiguous, because if someone has a stake in research data, it does not mean that they are owners of that data (Briney, 2015).', 'Many DG skills, such as dealing with licensing terms and agreements, as well as knowledge about copyright are already possessed by librarians (Krier and Strasser, 2014).', 'Altogether, data governance is the starting point for managing data.', 'A formal data governance program has to provide answers to questions, such as the', 'IFLA Journal 42(4)', 'As a shared responsibil- ity among all constituents of an institution, it is also required to provide coordinated, cross-functional approaches and to facilitate best practices.', 'It both prevents the misuse of institutional data assets and encourages more effective use of these same data assets by the institution itself (ECAR, 2015).', 'Being knowledgeable about data governance’s nature is foundational for RDSs and well-developed data gov- ernance is one of the necessary conditions for open data (Weber et al., 2012), even though it is also one of the most challenging issues of data sharing (Krier and Strasser, 2014).', 'Data governance and managing data quality Data governance also ‘guarantees that data can be trusted and that people can be made accountable for any adverse event that happens because of poor qual- ity’ (Sarsfield, 2009: 38).', 'In a similar vein, Khatri and Brown (2010) underline that governance includes establishing who in the organization holds decision rights for determining standards for data quality.', 'Data management involves determining the actual criteria employed for data quality, while DG is about desig- nating who should make these decisions.', 'According to Seiner (2014), DG formalizes not only behaviour related to the definition, production and usage of data, but its quality.', 'Similarly, a White Paper by Informa- tion Builders (2014) emphasizes that data governance is a critical component of any data quality manage- ment strategy.', 'Another White Paper, titled Successful Information Governance through High-Quality Data, underlines that the success of an information govern- ance program depends on robust data quality that can be achieved if we reduce the proliferation of incorrect or inconsistent data by continuous analysis and mon- itoring (IBM, 2012).', 'Data quality is one of the cornerstones of the data- intensive paradigm of scientific research.', 'This is true, even if it is difficult to appraise data, because apprai- sal requires deep disciplinary knowledge and manu- ally appraising data sets is very time consuming and expensive, while automated approaches are in their infancy (Ramı´rez, 2011).', 'In the academic sphere, the problem of data quality has been relatively well ela- borated, thus an exhaustive further treatment of it is not needed.', 'Nonetheless, let us repeat its most notable factors, which are availability and discoverability, trust and authenticity, acceptability, accuracy (com- prising correctness and consistency), applicability, integrity, completeness, understandability and', 'IBM, 2012).', 'It is also clear that research data services offered by academic libraries could play a critical role as data quality hubs on campus, by providing data quality auditing and verification ser- vices for the research communities (Giarlo, 2013).', 'While caring for the availability of data would be a self-explanatory requirement, directed towards data librarians, being knowledgeable about the ways to assess the digital objects’ authenticity, integrity and accuracy over time would also be useful (Madrid, 2013).', 'More recently, Zilinski and Nelson (2014) identified some other factors of data quality as cover- age and relevance to the given research question and format, comprising fields and units used, naming con- ventions, dates of creation and update.', 'They also direct our attention to a set of quality control attributes that are akin to data governance that answer the ques- tion if quality control is explicitly outlined by exam- ining who is in charge of checking for quality and what processes do they use.', 'Successful data governance depends not only on provisions related to roles in general, but responsibil- ities connected with appropriate data standards and managed metadata environments (Smith, 2007).', 'Therefore, managing metadata is one of the key quality-related processes of data governance because it enables – among other things – documenting the provenance of data that ensures its quality is secured (ORACLE, 2015).', 'Data governance, data quality and data literacy To illustrate the importance of appropriate DG, we can take the case study presented by Soares (2012) about the unfortunate events surrounding the Mars Climate Orbiter.', 'In 1999, a navigation error directed the Orbiter into a trajectory 170 kilometres lower than the intended altitude above Mars, because NASA’s engineers used English units (pounds) instead of NASA specified metric units (newtons).', 'This rela- tively minor mistake resulted in a huge miscalculation in orbital altitude and in the loss of $328m.', 'With appropriate attention to data governance principles and to the actual details, and if data literacy skills had been mobilized, this accident could have been avoided.', 'Even though data literacy is going through a gesta- tion period (Carlson and Johnston, 2015), being data literate begins to be widely accepted as a crucial abil- ity for information professionals involved in support- ing data-intensive research (Koltay, 2015b; Qin and D’Ignazio, 2010; Schneider, 2013).', 'On the other hand, the terminology in the field of data literacy is', 'Koltay: Data governance, data literacy and the management of data quality', 'There is science data literacy (Qin and D’Ignazio, 2010) and research data literacy (Schneider, 2013).', 'Carlson et al.', 'In the following, naming differences will be disregarded, and we will vote for the term data literacy first of all because this term is simple and straightforward (Koltay, 2015a), while it does not seem to have the limitation men- tioned by Carlson et al.', 'Besides of this, while the terms differ, definitions and competence lists show convergence.', 'If we look to the development of data literacy’s definitions, we can see that Fosmire and Miller (2008) spoke simply about information literacy in the data world.', 'Two years later, data lit- eracy was defined plainly as the ability to understand, use and manage data (Qin and D’Ignazio (2010).', 'According to Calzada Prado and Marzal’s (2013) def- inition, data literacy enables individuals to access, interpret, critically assess, manage, handle and ethi- cally use data.', 'As mentioned above, Johnson (2012) described data literacy in much more detail, defining it as the ability to process, sort and filter vast quantities of information, which requires knowing how to search, how to filter and process, to produce and synthesize.', 'It is clear that these attributes are basically identical to the characteristics of information literacy as they appear in the well-known and widely accepted def- inition of information literacy, which comprises the abilities to recognize information need, identify, locate, evaluate, and use information to solve a par- ticular problem (ALA, 1989).', 'Nonetheless, it has to be added that – while information literacy seems essentially to enable us to efficiently process all types of information content (Badke, 2010) – the community of practice for data librarians differs from that of information literacy (Carlson and Johnston, 2015).', 'As to the similarities to information literacy, it has to be added that several authors emphasize it.', 'The Australian and New Zealand Information Literacy Framework, edited by Alan Bundy (2004) states that information literate persons obtain, store and dissemi- nate not only text, but data as well.', 'Andretta et al.', 'According to Hunt (2004), data literacy education should borrow heavily from information literacy education, even if the', 'Schneider (2013) also defined data literacy as a component of information literacy.', 'Both the SCONUL (2011) Seven Pillars of Infor- mation Literacy model and the information literacy lens on the Vitae Researcher Development Frame- work (Vitae, 2011) stress that to identify which infor- mation could provide the best material to answer an information need, finding, producing and dealing with research data is important, as information literacy today not only encompasses published information and underlying data.', 'This is in accordance with a broader interpretation of information literacy, which recognizes that the concept of information includes research data (RIN, 2011).', 'Carlson et al.', 'Si et al.', 'Even though without referring to data literacy, Wang (2013) mentions that reference librarians fre- quently conduct information literacy sessions that educate the users about the existing data resources for their specific study areas.', 'Calzada Prado and Marzal (2013) state that infor- mation literacy and data literacy form part of a scientific-investigative educational continuum, a gra- dual process of education that begins in school, is perfected and becomes specialized in higher educa- tion, and becomes part of lifelong learning.', 'When suggesting a new framework for data literacy educa- tion, Maybee and Zilinski (2015) also point towards the close relationship between information literacy and data literacy.', 'Beyond definitions, applying and analysis of several information literacy standards, Calzada Prado and Marzal (2013: 126) identified a number of abilities, some of which clearly show their ori- gin in the best-known definition of information literacy (ALA, 1989) and the Information Literacy Competency Standards for Higher Education (ACRL, 2000).', 'IFLA Journal 42(4)', 'They also emphasize the ability to identify the con- text in which data is produced and reused.', 'By men- tioning these two main components of the data lifecycle they are in line with contemporary views of information literacy that incorporate the under- standing of how information is produced (ACRL, 2013).', 'Mandinach and Gummer (2013) identify data lit- eracy as the ability to understand and use data effec- tively to inform decisions.', 'With this, they give weight to data literacy’s role in supporting decision making.', 'Therefore, they bring data literacy up to data govern- ance, recognizing that it may be tied to the world of business.', 'Data literacy, as it is understood by the Association of College and Research Libraries, focuses on under- standing how to find and evaluate data, giving empha- sis to the version of the given dataset and the person responsible for it, and does not neglect the questions of citing and ethical use of data (ACRL, 2013).', 'Taking all these definitions together, data literacy can be defined as a specific skill set and knowledge base, which empowers individuals to transform data into information and into actionable knowledge by enabling them to access, interpret, critically assess, manage and ethically use data (Koltay, 2015a).', 'Searle et al.', 'RDSs activities that support researchers in building the skills and knowledge required to manage data well.', 'Therefore, we can say that data literacy is related to practically all processes that are covered by RDSs, and build the main framework of libraries’ involve- ment in supporting the data-intensive paradigm of research (Tenopir et al., 2014).', 'RDSs are undoubtedly comprehensive, thus covering their aspects makes data literacy overarching and comprehensive.', 'When taking the closeness of data literacy to infor- mation literacy into consideration, it is intriguing to contemplate if there is such a thing as generic infor- mation literacy.', 'According to Carlson et al.', 'A bibliometric study by Pinto et al.', 'In gen- eral, newer approaches to information literacy under- line that information is used in different disciplinary contexts (Maybee and Zilinski, 2015).', 'In this context, the case of chemical information literacy is especially', 'Bawden and Robinson (2015) examined its history and found that – while chemical informa- tion literacy contains some generic elements – it is more strongly domain specific than any other subject.', 'As Farrell and Badke (2015) underline, in order to meet the demand of the information age for skilled handlers of information, information literacy educa- tion must become situated within the socio-cultural practices of disciplines by an expanded focus on epis- temology and metanarrative.', 'Truly situated informa- tion literacy will therefore require that librarians or disciplinary faculty invite students into disciplines.', 'Therefore, information literacy has to be understood as information practices belonging to a discipline.', 'Data literacy skills are also regarded to be disci- pline specific (Carlson and Johnston, 2015).', 'As to the required skills and abilities, data literate persons have to know how to select and synthesize data and com- bine it with other information sources and prior knowledge.', 'They also have to recognize source data value and be familiar with data types and formats (Calzada Prado and Marzal, 2013).', 'Other skills include knowing how to identify, collect, organize, analyse, summarize and prioritize data.', 'Developing hypotheses, identifying problems, interpreting the data, and determining, planning, implementing, as well as monitoring courses of action also pertain to required skills and add the need for tailoring data literacy to specific uses (Mandinach and Gummer, 2013).', 'Ridsdale et al.', 'The perhaps most important activity in this matrix is qual- ity evaluation that includes assessing sources of data for trustworthiness and for errors or problems.', 'Eva- luation appears already when we collect data and data interpretation clearly shows the mechanisms that also characterize information literacy.', 'Even data visuali- zation comprises evaluating and critically assessing graphical representations of data.', 'A pilot data literacy program on data literacy offered at Purdue University was built around the following skills:', 'Koltay: Data governance, data literacy and the management of data quality', 'Carlson and Stowell Bracke, 2015)', 'Faculty members are busy, and being experts in their fields, they usually require different approaches to instruction than stu- dents (Carlson and Johnston, 2015).', 'The fact that data quality plays a distinguished role in data literacy is also demonstrated by Carlson et al.', 'Generally, faculty in this study expected their graduate students to be able to carry out data management and handling activities.', 'Both major responsibilities and deficiencies in data management of graduate students included quality assurance.', 'Qual- ity assurance is seen as a blend of technical skills that materializes in familiarity with equipment, disciplin- ary knowledge and a metacognitive process that requires synthesis.', 'Even though partly superseded by the Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education (ACRL, 2015), data literacy can be seen through the prism of the Information Literacy Competency Standards for Higher Education (ACRL, 2000).', 'Standard 3 of these Standards (Evaluate infor- mation critically) contains the requirement of under- standing and critically assessing sources by determining if the given data is reputable and/or if the data repository or its members provide a level of qual- ity control for its content.', 'As mentioned above, managing metadata is one of the key quality-related processes of data governance.', 'At the same time, the appraisal of metadata is part of quality assurance that should be included in data lit- eracy programs.', 'Quality assurance in this context comprises utilising metadata to facilitate understand- ing of potential problems with data (Ridsdale et al., 2015).', 'Data literacy education has a dual purpose.', 'The first one is rather self-explanatory, i.e. to ensure that students, faculty and researchers become data literate science workers.', 'As Carlson and Johnston (2015) underline, we must raise awareness of data literacy among faculty, students and administrators by send- ing clear messages to our stakeholders’ needs.', 'Some of these messages could have their roots in business environments.', 'Conveying corporate messages may even strengthen the credibility of such messages.', 'The second goal is to educate information professionals (Qin and D’Ignazio, 2010; Schneider, 2013).', 'Imparting data literacy to faculty is hampered by the circumstance that educating them is a delicate issue.', 'As Duncan et al.', 'Exner (2014) also confirms', 'Conclusion Although being familiar with data governance did not receive a lot of attention in academia, it brings sub- stantial knowledge to the work of the data librarian.', 'Despite differences between them, both data govern- ance and data literacy are indispensable for managing data quality, thus – by their overarching nature – making use of them is a prerequisite of effective and efficient data management that substantiates research data services.', 'Making use of the lessons learnt from data govern- ance could substantially enhance the effectiveness of research data management processes in academic libraries.', 'The reasons for this are manifold.', 'First, in delineating decision domains and defining account- ability for decision making, applying practices adopted form data governance can improve data man- agement in the library.', 'Second, data governance is a service that is based on standardized, repeatable pro- cesses and is designed to enable the transparency of data-related processes and cost reduction, thus it can be used also in the academic library.', 'Third, it refers to rules, policies, standards; decision rights; account- abilities and methods of enforcement.', 'Therefore, it would serve as a pragmatic addition to already exist- ing data quality principles, practices and tools of the library.', 'Fourth, the practice of data governance can also be helpful in managing change and negotiating big data issues.', 'These lessons can speak for themselves and may be built into data literacy programs.', 'It is important for the library profession to take this challenge seriously and acquire the skills needed to provide effective data literacy education, irrespective of the fact that its competencies extend beyond the knowledge and skills of a typical librarian, or a faculty member.', 'Paying attention to the management of data quality (also tak- ing data governance into consideration) is an impor- tant step towards making all our target audiences accept the library’s mission to provide research data services and to offer these services to their full satisfaction.', 'Declaration of conflicting interests The author(s) declared no potential

management.', 'Applying data governance to research data management processes and data literacy education helps in delineating decision domains and defining accountability for decision making.', 'Adopting data governance is advantageous, because it is a service based on standardised, repeatable processes and is designed to enable the transparency of data-related processes and cost

corporate settings and some of the skills related to it are already possessed by librarians, knowledge on data governance is foundational for research data services, especially as it appears on all levels of research data services, and is applicable to big data.', 'Keywords Data governance, data-intensive research, data librarian, data literacy, research data services', 'Submitted: 11 May 2016; Accepted: 6 September 2016.', 'Introduction Data intensive science, coupled with mandates for data management plans and open data from research funders, has led to a growing emphasis on research data management both in academia and in academic libraries.', 'The role of the latter is changing, so aca- demic librarians are often integrated in the research process, first of all in the framework of research data services (RDSs) (Tenopir et al., 2015).', 'Therefore, it comes as no surprise that supporting data-intensive research is a top trend in academic library work (ACRL, 2014; NMC, 2014).', 'It is in focus especially because it gives the chance to change the present situation, where faculty and researchers regard the library not as a place of real-time research support, but only as a dispensary of books and articles (Jahnke et al., 2012).', 'Against this background, a review of the literature was done in order to identify and examine significant constituents of the knowledge base that is crucial for information professionals involved in supporting data-intensive research.', 'The first constituent is data governance (DG), which is extensively dealt with', 'RDSs. The second one is data literacy, about which there is a massive body of literature, among others in the form of review articles (Koltay, 2015a, 2015b; MacMillan, 2014).', 'Data literacy is closely related to research data ser- vices that include research data management (RDM).', 'As the concept of RDSs itself and data literacy edu- cation are still evolving, their relationship to data governance requires examination that may lead to some kind of synthesis.', 'The management of data quality is also inspected in order to determine to what extent it plays the role of an interface between these two constituents.', 'Accordingly, this writing is built on three core terms.', 'Data governance can be defined as the exercise of decision making and authority that comprises a', 'Corresponding author: Tibor Koltay, Eszterha´zy Ka´roly University, Ra´ko´ czi u´ t 53, Ja´szbere´ny, 5100, Hungary.', 'Email: koltay.tibor@uni-eszterhazy.hu', 'IFLA Journal 42(4)', 'DGI, 2015a).', 'While the various definitions of data literacy will be discussed below, we define it here as the ability to process, sort and filter vast quantities of information, which requires knowing how to search, how to filter and process, to produce and synthesize it (Johnson, 2012).', 'This definition is in accordance with the idea, expressed by Schneider (2013), that the boundaries between information in information literacy and data in data literacy are blurring, because these boundaries never have been rigid.', 'Research data services consist of a wide spectre of informational and technical services that a library offers to researchers in managing the full data life cycle (Tenopir et al., 2012).', 'Research data services and the paradigms of academic library management A better understanding of the academic libraries’ role in the data-intensive environment can be obtained if we place them into the context of academic librarian- ship’s past and present development paradigms, out- lined by Martell (2009).', 'The first paradigm, called the ‘Ownership’ or ‘Collections’ paradigm evolved after World War II and reached its zenith in the 1960s.', 'It was built on the assumption that campus library sys- tems would be able to collect all documents that could adequately satisfy the institutions’ scholarly and teaching needs.', 'Such support allowed for a broad range of interpretations, but it proved to be unsustain- able and was supplanted by the ‘Access’ paradigm that directed more attention to and made use of resource sharing from the late 1970s until the end of the 20th century.', 'Widespread access to digital mate- rial, in particular the availability of electronic full text of serials made ownership in its traditional sense not practical, so the ‘iAccess’ paradigm came into being.', 'More recently, the emergence and growing preva- lence of social media creates an opportunity to add social dimension to iAccess, forging in this way the ‘sAccess’ paradigm.', 'While social media undoubtedly plays a role in Research 2.0, it is often difficult to disentangle the relationship between features that are induced by its presence from the influence of the growing impor- tance of data.', 'Social media influences academic libraries in many ways.', 'It produces enormous quan- tities of (big) data that can be analysed, published and reused mainly by researchers in the social sciences (Boyd and Crawford, 2012).', 'It also changes the ways', 'Nicholas et al, 2014).', 'Therefore, it is a demanding task to define to what extent data-intensive research pertains to iAccess and to sAccess.', 'In any case, both paradigms have influ- ence on it to some degree.', 'Data governance in detail As stated above, data governance is a subject of inter- est for the business sector.', 'Therefore, it is rarely addressed by the LIS literature.', 'A notable exception is the work of Krier and Strasser (2014) that focuses on data management in libraries.', 'A review of definitions of data government by Smith (2007) clearly shows the close ties of DG to the business sector.', 'Besides providing a set of defini- tions that relate it to companies, enterprises and busi- ness, Smith underlines that ‘the process of data governance is to exercise control over the data within a corporate alignment’.', 'It seems clear that the academic sector, librarian- ship, as well as library and information science also should pay attention to DG, albeit it attracted attention mainly in the business sector.', 'Even though rather implicitly, this need is asserted by DosSantos (2015), who points out that the role of the data gov- ernor must shift to be something more akin to a data librarian in order to make data governance the driving force behind business innovation, instead of being an impediment to data.', 'This goal can be attained by deli- vering information technology as a service and by enabling the processes of locating and organizing the best available data.', 'The expression data governance could refer to organizational bodies; rules, policies, standards; deci- sion rights; accountabilities and methods of enforce- ment.', 'DG enables better decision making and protects the needs of stakeholders.', 'It reduces operational fric- tion and encourages the adoption of common approaches to data issues.', 'Data governance also helps build standard, repeatable processes, reduce costs and increase effectiveness through coordination of efforts and by enabling transparency of processes.', 'It is gov- erned by the principles of integrity, transparency and auditability (DGI, 2015a).', 'DG also delineates decision domains, i.e. what decisions must be made to ensure effective manage- ment and use of the organization’s assets.', 'It also defines the locus of accountability for decision mak- ing by defining who is entitled to make decisions in a given organization, and who is held accountable for the decision making related to data assets (Khatri and', 'Koltay: Data governance, data literacy and the management of data quality', 'Brown, 2010; Weill and Ross, 2004).', 'Seiner (2014: 2) adds to this that valid data governance may require identifying ‘people who informally already have a level of accountability for the data they define, pro- duce and use to complete their jobs or functions’.', 'One of the reasons for this is that correct and efficient governance depends as much on technology as on organizational culture, despite the fact that good gov- ernance technology makes data transparent, gives it accountability and helps identify areas where perfor- mance can be improved (ORACLE, 2015).', 'Accountabilities, the main components of which are stewardship and standardization, are defined in a manner that introduces checks and balances between different teams, between those who create and collect information, others who manage it, those who use it, and those who introduce standards and compliance requirements (DGI, 2015b).', 'As stewardship appears in this list and is also pres- ent in several resources related to research data man- agement (Bailey, 2015), and because it is sometimes used interchangeably with DG, some clarification is needed.', 'Data stewardship is concerned with taking care of data assets that do not belong to the stewards themselves, thus data stewards represent the concerns of others, and ensure that data-related work is per- formed according to policies and practices as deter- In contrast, data mined through governance.', 'Rosenbaum, 2010).', 'To be successful, data governance needs to have clear definitions of its objectives, processes and metrics.', 'It has to create its own processes and stan- dards.', 'Besides roles and responsibilities for all data governance roles, communities of practice for gov- ernance, stewardship and information management have to be established.', 'Change management pro- cesses also have to be instituted, and – last but not least – there have to be rewards for good data govern- ance behaviour.', 'Data governance should not be optional, because it contributes to organizational success through repeata- ble and compliant practices.', 'In the sense of managing, monitoring and measuring different aspects of an organization, governance can be related to managing information technology, people and other tangible resources.', 'Data is everywhere, thus DG runs horizon- tally.', 'Definitions of the data and how to use it are part of the data management process, while integrating data into the organization and establishing individuals to oversee the administration of data processes pertain', 'DG also must include metadata, unstructured data, registries, taxonomies and ontolo- gies (Smith, 2007).', 'The traditional principles of DG also apply to big data.', 'From among big data types, data from the Web and from social media, as well as machine-to-machine data deserve special attention.', 'Big data governance is especially important in regard to the acceptable use of data (Soares, 2012).', 'In environments where big data plays a substantial role, one of the most common data integration mistakes is underestimating data govern- ance (ORACLE, 2015).', 'Although big data integration differs from traditional data integration by many fac- tors (Dong and Srivastava, 2013), it demonstrates the complexity and importance of data governance.', 'Data integration itself can be defined as the combination of technical and business processes used to combine data from disparate sources into meaningful and valuable information.', 'It helps to understand, cleanse, monitor, transform and deliver data, thus it supplies trusted data from a variety of sources (IBM, 2016).', 'Data integration solves the problems related to combining data of varied provenance by presenting a unified view of these data (Lenzerini, 2002).', 'As Sarsfield (2009) put it, DG is like an elephant in a dark room.', 'It can be perceived depending on where you touch it.', 'If you touch its tail, it feels like a snake.', 'If you touch one of its legs, it feels like a tree.', 'There- fore, cross-functional perspectives on data govern- ance vary, and we will take this variability into consideration to couple it with data quality and data literacy.', 'In research settings, the stakeholders of DG are researchers, research institutions, funders, publishers and the public at large.', 'A good understanding of data governance also addresses researchers’ fear of lost rights and benefits.', 'Governance structures are needed for managing human subjects-related data as well, because taking care of sensitive information requires not only establishing standards and norms of practice, but fostering culture change towards better data stew- ardship (Hartter et al., 2013).', 'In addition to these functions, data governance in this environment enables proper access and sharing (Riley, 2015), even if data ownership is often ambiguous, because if someone has a stake in research data, it does not mean that they are owners of that data (Briney, 2015).', 'Many DG skills, such as dealing with licensing terms and agreements, as well as knowledge about copyright are already possessed by librarians (Krier and Strasser, 2014).', 'Altogether, data governance is the starting point for managing data.', 'A formal data governance program has to provide answers to questions, such as the', 'IFLA Journal 42(4)', 'As a shared responsibil- ity among all constituents of an institution, it is also required to provide coordinated, cross-functional approaches and to facilitate best practices.', 'It both prevents the misuse of institutional data assets and encourages more effective use of these same data assets by the institution itself (ECAR, 2015).', 'Being knowledgeable about data governance’s nature is foundational for RDSs and well-developed data gov- ernance is one of the necessary conditions for open data (Weber et al., 2012), even though it is also one of the most challenging issues of data sharing (Krier and Strasser, 2014).', 'Data governance and managing data quality Data governance also ‘guarantees that data can be trusted and that people can be made accountable for any adverse event that happens because of poor qual- ity’ (Sarsfield, 2009: 38).', 'In a similar vein, Khatri and Brown (2010) underline that governance includes establishing who in the organization holds decision rights for determining standards for data quality.', 'Data management involves determining the actual criteria employed for data quality, while DG is about desig- nating who should make these decisions.', 'According to Seiner (2014), DG formalizes not only behaviour related to the definition, production and usage of data, but its quality.', 'Similarly, a White Paper by Informa- tion Builders (2014) emphasizes that data governance is a critical component of any data quality manage- ment strategy.', 'Another White Paper, titled Successful Information Governance through High-Quality Data, underlines that the success of an information govern- ance program depends on robust data quality that can be achieved if we reduce the proliferation of incorrect or inconsistent data by continuous analysis and mon- itoring (IBM, 2012).', 'Data quality is one of the cornerstones of the data- intensive paradigm of scientific research.', 'This is true, even if it is difficult to appraise data, because apprai- sal requires deep disciplinary knowledge and manu- ally appraising data sets is very time consuming and expensive, while automated approaches are in their infancy (Ramı´rez, 2011).', 'In the academic sphere, the problem of data quality has been relatively well ela- borated, thus an exhaustive further treatment of it is not needed.', 'Nonetheless, let us repeat its most notable factors, which are availability and discoverability, trust and authenticity, acceptability, accuracy (com- prising correctness and consistency), applicability, integrity, completeness, understandability and', 'IBM, 2012).', 'It is also clear that research data services offered by academic libraries could play a critical role as data quality hubs on campus, by providing data quality auditing and verification ser- vices for the research communities (Giarlo, 2013).', 'While caring for the availability of data would be a self-explanatory requirement, directed towards data librarians, being knowledgeable about the ways to assess the digital objects’ authenticity, integrity and accuracy over time would also be useful (Madrid, 2013).', 'More recently, Zilinski and Nelson (2014) identified some other factors of data quality as cover- age and relevance to the given research question and format, comprising fields and units used, naming con- ventions, dates of creation and update.', 'They also direct our attention to a set of quality control attributes that are akin to data governance that answer the ques- tion if quality control is explicitly outlined by exam- ining who is in charge of checking for quality and what processes do they use.', 'Successful data governance depends not only on provisions related to roles in general, but responsibil- ities connected with appropriate data standards and managed metadata environments (Smith, 2007).', 'Therefore, managing metadata is one of the key quality-related processes of data governance because it enables – among other things – documenting the provenance of data that ensures its quality is secured (ORACLE, 2015).', 'Data governance, data quality and data literacy To illustrate the importance of appropriate DG, we can take the case study presented by Soares (2012) about the unfortunate events surrounding the Mars Climate Orbiter.', 'In 1999, a navigation error directed the Orbiter into a trajectory 170 kilometres lower than the intended altitude above Mars, because NASA’s engineers used English units (pounds) instead of NASA specified metric units (newtons).', 'This rela- tively minor mistake resulted in a huge miscalculation in orbital altitude and in the loss of $328m.', 'With appropriate attention to data governance principles and to the actual details, and if data literacy skills had been mobilized, this accident could have been avoided.', 'Even though data literacy is going through a gesta- tion period (Carlson and Johnston, 2015), being data literate begins to be widely accepted as a crucial abil- ity for information professionals involved in support- ing data-intensive research (Koltay, 2015b; Qin and D’Ignazio, 2010; Schneider, 2013).', 'On the other hand, the terminology in the field of data literacy is', 'Koltay: Data governance, data literacy and the management of data quality', 'There is science data literacy (Qin and D’Ignazio, 2010) and research data literacy (Schneider, 2013).', 'Carlson et al.', 'In the following, naming differences will be disregarded, and we will vote for the term data literacy first of all because this term is simple and straightforward (Koltay, 2015a), while it does not seem to have the limitation men- tioned by Carlson et al.', 'Besides of this, while the terms differ, definitions and competence lists show convergence.', 'If we look to the development of data literacy’s definitions, we can see that Fosmire and Miller (2008) spoke simply about information literacy in the data world.', 'Two years later, data lit- eracy was defined plainly as the ability to understand, use and manage data (Qin and D’Ignazio (2010).', 'According to Calzada Prado and Marzal’s (2013) def- inition, data literacy enables individuals to access, interpret, critically assess, manage, handle and ethi- cally use data.', 'As mentioned above, Johnson (2012) described data literacy in much more detail, defining it as the ability to process, sort and filter vast quantities of information, which requires knowing how to search, how to filter and process, to produce and synthesize.', 'It is clear that these attributes are basically identical to the characteristics of information literacy as they appear in the well-known and widely accepted def- inition of information literacy, which comprises the abilities to recognize information need, identify, locate, evaluate, and use information to solve a par- ticular problem (ALA, 1989).', 'Nonetheless, it has to be added that – while information literacy seems essentially to enable us to efficiently process all types of information content (Badke, 2010) – the community of practice for data librarians differs from that of information literacy (Carlson and Johnston, 2015).', 'As to the similarities to information literacy, it has to be added that several authors emphasize it.', 'The Australian and New Zealand Information Literacy Framework, edited by Alan Bundy (2004) states that information literate persons obtain, store and dissemi- nate not only text, but data as well.', 'Andretta et al.', 'According to Hunt (2004), data literacy education should borrow heavily from information literacy education, even if the', 'Schneider (2013) also defined data literacy as a component of information literacy.', 'Both the SCONUL (2011) Seven Pillars of Infor- mation Literacy model and the information literacy lens on the Vitae Researcher Development Frame- work (Vitae, 2011) stress that to identify which infor- mation could provide the best material to answer an information need, finding, producing and dealing with research data is important, as information literacy today not only encompasses published information and underlying data.', 'This is in accordance with a broader interpretation of information literacy, which recognizes that the concept of information includes research data (RIN, 2011).', 'Carlson et al.', 'Si et al.', 'Even though without referring to data literacy, Wang (2013) mentions that reference librarians fre- quently conduct information literacy sessions that educate the users about the existing data resources for their specific study areas.', 'Calzada Prado and Marzal (2013) state that infor- mation literacy and data literacy form part of a scientific-investigative educational continuum, a gra- dual process of education that begins in school, is perfected and becomes specialized in higher educa- tion, and becomes part of lifelong learning.', 'When suggesting a new framework for data literacy educa- tion, Maybee and Zilinski (2015) also point towards the close relationship between information literacy and data literacy.', 'Beyond definitions, applying and analysis of several information literacy standards, Calzada Prado and Marzal (2013: 126) identified a number of abilities, some of which clearly show their ori- gin in the best-known definition of information literacy (ALA, 1989) and the Information Literacy Competency Standards for Higher Education (ACRL, 2000).', 'IFLA Journal 42(4)', 'They also emphasize the ability to identify the con- text in which data is produced and reused.', 'By men- tioning these two main components of the data lifecycle they are in line with contemporary views of information literacy that incorporate the under- standing of how information is produced (ACRL, 2013).', 'Mandinach and Gummer (2013) identify data lit- eracy as the ability to understand and use data effec- tively to inform decisions.', 'With this, they give weight to data literacy’s role in supporting decision making.', 'Therefore, they bring data literacy up to data govern- ance, recognizing that it may be tied to the world of business.', 'Data literacy, as it is understood by the Association of College and Research Libraries, focuses on under- standing how to find and evaluate data, giving empha- sis to the version of the given dataset and the person responsible for it, and does not neglect the questions of citing and ethical use of data (ACRL, 2013).', 'Taking all these definitions together, data literacy can be defined as a specific skill set and knowledge base, which empowers individuals to transform data into information and into actionable knowledge by enabling them to access, interpret, critically assess, manage and ethically use data (Koltay, 2015a).', 'Searle et al.', 'RDSs activities that support researchers in building the skills and knowledge required to manage data well.', 'Therefore, we can say that data literacy is related to practically all processes that are covered by RDSs, and build the main framework of libraries’ involve- ment in supporting the data-intensive paradigm of research (Tenopir et al., 2014).', 'RDSs are undoubtedly comprehensive, thus covering their aspects makes data literacy overarching and comprehensive.', 'When taking the closeness of data literacy to infor- mation literacy into consideration, it is intriguing to contemplate if there is such a thing as generic infor- mation literacy.', 'According to Carlson et al.', 'A bibliometric study by Pinto et al.', 'In gen- eral, newer approaches to information literacy under- line that information is used in different disciplinary contexts (Maybee and Zilinski, 2015).', 'In this context, the case of chemical information literacy is especially', 'Bawden and Robinson (2015) examined its history and found that – while chemical informa- tion literacy contains some generic elements – it is more strongly domain specific than any other subject.', 'As Farrell and Badke (2015) underline, in order to meet the demand of the information age for skilled handlers of information, information literacy educa- tion must become situated within the socio-cultural practices of disciplines by an expanded focus on epis- temology and metanarrative.', 'Truly situated informa- tion literacy will therefore require that librarians or disciplinary faculty invite students into disciplines.', 'Therefore, information literacy has to be understood as information practices belonging to a discipline.', 'Data literacy skills are also regarded to be disci- pline specific (Carlson and Johnston, 2015).', 'As to the required skills and abilities, data literate persons have to know how to select and synthesize data and com- bine it with other information sources and prior knowledge.', 'They also have to recognize source data value and be familiar with data types and formats (Calzada Prado and Marzal, 2013).', 'Other skills include knowing how to identify, collect, organize, analyse, summarize and prioritize data.', 'Developing hypotheses, identifying problems, interpreting the data, and determining, planning, implementing, as well as monitoring courses of action also pertain to required skills and add the need for tailoring data literacy to specific uses (Mandinach and Gummer, 2013).', 'Ridsdale et al.', 'The perhaps most important activity in this matrix is qual- ity evaluation that includes assessing sources of data for trustworthiness and for errors or problems.', 'Eva- luation appears already when we collect data and data interpretation clearly shows the mechanisms that also characterize information literacy.', 'Even data visuali- zation comprises evaluating and critically assessing graphical representations of data.', 'A pilot data literacy program on data literacy offered at Purdue University was built around the following skills:', 'Koltay: Data governance, data literacy and the management of data quality', 'Carlson and Stowell Bracke, 2015)', 'Faculty members are busy, and being experts in their fields, they usually require different approaches to instruction than stu- dents (Carlson and Johnston, 2015).', 'The fact that data quality plays a distinguished role in data literacy is also demonstrated by Carlson et al.', 'Generally, faculty in this study expected their graduate students to be able to carry out data management and handling activities.', 'Both major responsibilities and deficiencies in data management of graduate students included quality assurance.', 'Qual- ity assurance is seen as a blend of technical skills that materializes in familiarity with equipment, disciplin- ary knowledge and a metacognitive process that requires synthesis.', 'Even though partly superseded by the Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education (ACRL, 2015), data literacy can be seen through the prism of the Information Literacy Competency Standards for Higher Education (ACRL, 2000).', 'Standard 3 of these Standards (Evaluate infor- mation critically) contains the requirement of under- standing and critically assessing sources by determining if the given data is reputable and/or if the data repository or its members provide a level of qual- ity control for its content.', 'As mentioned above, managing metadata is one of the key quality-related processes of data governance.', 'At the same time, the appraisal of metadata is part of quality assurance that should be included in data lit- eracy programs.', 'Quality assurance in this context comprises utilising metadata to facilitate understand- ing of potential problems with data (Ridsdale et al., 2015).', 'Data literacy education has a dual purpose.', 'The first one is rather self-explanatory, i.e. to ensure that students, faculty and researchers become data literate science workers.', 'As Carlson and Johnston (2015) underline, we must raise awareness of data literacy among faculty, students and administrators by send- ing clear messages to our stakeholders’ needs.', 'Some of these messages could have their roots in business environments.', 'Conveying corporate messages may even strengthen the credibility of such messages.', 'The second goal is to educate information professionals (Qin and D’Ignazio, 2010; Schneider, 2013).', 'Imparting data literacy to faculty is hampered by the circumstance that educating them is a delicate issue.', 'As Duncan et al.', 'Exner (2014) also confirms', 'Conclusion Although being familiar with data governance did not receive a lot of attention in academia, it brings sub- stantial knowledge to the work of the data librarian.', 'Despite differences between them, both data govern- ance and data literacy are indispensable for managing data quality, thus – by their overarching nature – making use of them is a prerequisite of effective and efficient data management that substantiates research data services.', 'Making use of the lessons learnt from data govern- ance could substantially enhance the effectiveness of research data management processes in academic libraries.', 'The reasons for this are manifold.', 'First, in delineating decision domains and defining account- ability for decision making, applying practices adopted form data governance can improve data man- agement in the library.', 'Second, data governance is a service that is based on standardized, repeatable pro- cesses and is designed to enable the transparency of data-related processes and cost reduction, thus it can be used also in the academic library.', 'Third, it refers to rules, policies, standards; decision rights; account- abilities and methods of enforcement.', 'Therefore, it would serve as a pragmatic addition to already exist- ing data quality principles, practices and tools of the library.', 'Fourth, the practice of data governance can also be helpful in managing change and negotiating big data issues.', 'These lessons can speak for themselves and may be built into data literacy programs.', 'It is important for the library profession to take this challenge seriously and acquire the skills needed to provide effective data literacy education, irrespective of the fact that its competencies extend beyond the knowledge and skills of a typical librarian, or a faculty member.', 'Paying attention to the management of data quality (also tak- ing data governance into consideration) is an impor- tant step towards making all our target audiences accept the library’s mission to provide research data services and to offer these services to their full satisfaction.', 'Declaration of conflicting interests The author(s) declared no potential

governance as a promising  approach  for  companies  to  improve  and  maintain  the  quality  of  corporate  data,  which  is  seen  as  critical  for  being  able  to  meet  strategic  business  requirements,  such  as  compliance  or  integrated  customer management.', 'Both sides agree that data governance primarily is a matter of organisation.', 'However, hardly any scientific results have been produced so far indicating what actually has to be  organised by data governance, and what data governance may look like.', 'The  paper aims at closing  this  gap  by  developing  a  morphology  of  data  governance  organisation  on  the  basis  of  a  comprehensive analysis of the state of the art both in science and in practice.', 'Epistemologically, the  morphology  represents  an  analytic  theory,  as  it  serves  for  structuring  the  research  topic  of  data  governance, which is still quite unexplored.', 'Six mini case studies are used to evaluate the morphology  by means of empirical data.', 'Providing a foundation for further research, the morphology contributes  to  the  advancement  of  the  scientific  body  of  knowledge.', 'At  the  same  time,  it  is  beneficial  to  practitioners, as companies may use it as a guideline when organising data governance.', 'Keywords: Data governance, Organisational design, Theory development, Morphology.', 'Introduction ', 'Regarding the quality of their data, companies see themselves confronted with a number of strategic  business  requirements,  such  as  compliance  with  legal  and  regulatory  provisions  or  the  need  for  customer centric business models.', 'In this context, data governance is seen as a promising approach for  companies to improve and maintain the quality of their data (Panian, 2010).', 'Early definitions of the  term  have  been  rendered  both  by  researchers  (Khatri  and  Brown,  2010;  Weber  et  al.,  2009b)  and  practitioners (Karel, 2007; Russom, 2006).', 'Both sides agree that data governance refers to the entirety  of decision rights and responsibilities regarding the management of data assets.', 'Assigning decision rights within companies is a typical organisational task (Galbraith, 1974; Grochla,  1982).', 'As  to  the  organisation  of  data  governance,  both  researchers  and  practitioners  have  come  up  with a number of recommendations, such as functional diagrams linking decision rights to appropriate  roles (Dyché and Levy, 2006; McGilvray, 2007; Weber et al., 2009b), specification of roles such as  data stewards or data committees (Economist Intelligence Unit, 2008; Friedman, 2007; Loshin, 2007),  specification of decision rights (Khatri and Brown, 2010; Weber et al., 2009b), or recommendations  for establishing data governance in companies’ organisational structures (Karel, 2007; Vaygan et al.,  2007; Weber et al., 2009b).', 'What all these approaches  have in common is that they focus on single  aspects of data governance, what leads to isolated solutions only.', 'The fact that companies need to take  into account a number of aspects when trying to organise data governance has been neglected so far.', 'This  gap  both  in  the  scientific  and  in  the  practical  state  of  the  art  has  been  the  motivation  for  this  contribution.', 'The research question to be answered is: What are the aspects that need to be considered  in order to capture the entirety of data governance organisation?', 'To  accomplish  this  objective  the  paper  develops  a  morphology  of  data  governance  organisation.', 'In  general, a morphology is concerned with the “structure and arrangement of parts of an object, and how  these  conform  to  create  a  whole”  (Ritchey,  2006,  p.', 'Epistemologically,  a  morphology  follows  the principles of an “analytic theory” as specified by Gregor (2006, p.', 'Theories of this kind  describe the structure and the relations of the basic concepts of current phenomena for which only few  scientific results are available so far.', 'For theory development, a deductive approach (Wilde and Hess,  2006) is applied, based on a detailed analysis of both the scientific and the practical state of the art.', 'In  addition, mini case studies are used for a critical appraisal of the morphology.', 'A similar use of mini  case  studies  has  been  described  by  Weill  and  Olson  (1989)  in  their  investigation  on  investments  in  information technology (IT).', 'Background ', 'As  mentioned  above,  researchers  and  practitioners  agree  that  data  governance  is  basically  about  assigning decision rights and responsibilities when it comes to data management in companies (Karel,  2007; Khatri and Brown, 2010; Russom, 2006; Weber et al., 2009b; Wende and Otto, 2007).', 'It is also  common sense that data governance is of particular importance when it comes to the management of  master data, i.e. data about materials and products, customers and suppliers, for example (Dreibelbis et  al.,  2008;  Loshin,  2008).', 'Furthermore,  practitioners  and  researchers  agree  upon  the  fact  that  establishing  data  governance  is  an  organisational  design  task  (Lee  et  al.,  2006;  Pierce  et  al.,  2008).', 'However, a holistic perspective on the entirety of the several organisational concepts is still missing  with regard to data governance.', 'Therefore, in the following a conceptual framework of the different  dimensions of “organisation” as a theoretical concept is derived from studies on organisational design  in general and on the organisation of the IS function in particular.', 'The  first  organisational  dimension  relates  to  (1)  an  organisation’s  goals.', 'Grochla  (1982)  divides  the  them into (1A) formal goals and (1B) functional goals.', 'Whereas the former measure an organisation’s  performance, the latter refer to the tasks an organisation has to fulfil.', 'Transferred to the research area ', 'The second organisational dimension is (2) the organisational structure (Galbraith, 2002).', 'It comprises  three aspects, namely the positioning of decision-making power within the hierarchical structure of an  organisation (2A, “locus of control”), the division of labour and the (2B) organisational form resulting  from this, and the allocation of tasks to (2C) roles and committees.', 'Especially, the question regarding  the positioning of the “locus of control” with regard to decision-making on IT is a traditional research  area in IS

Organisation.', 'The  second  dimension  of  the  morphology  of  data  governance  organisation  is  its  structure.', 'The  first  aspect here refers to the “locus of control”, i.e. the main instance of responsibility for data governance  in a company.', 'Relevant sources have been discussing two questions with regard to the positioning of  the  locus  of  control:  its  functional  positioning  and  its  positioning  in  a  company’s  hierarchical  structure.', 'While  some  authors  see  the  functional  positioning  of  the  locus  of  control  in  business  departments  (Cheong  and  Chang,  2007;  Friedman,  2007;  NCC,  2006),  others  prefer  the  locus  of  control  to  be  in  a  company’s  IS/IT  department  (CDI  Institute,  2006;  Delbaere  and  Ferreira,  2007).', 'Quite  often,  however,  there  are  many  authors  suggesting  that  some  kind  of  shared  responsibility  should be established for data governance.', 'As Seiner (Seiner, 2007) puts it: “When I get asked if Data  Governance  should  ‘reside’  in  the  business  areas  or  the  IT  area,  my  answer  is  always  ...', 'Yes’.', 'It  should  reside  in  both.”  Regarding  the  hierarchical  positioning  of  the  locus  of  control  for  data  governance,  also  no  clear  trend  can  be  identified  when  looking  at  the  opinions  of  relevant  authors.', 'Many of them suggest data governance to be located both on the executive management level and on  the middle management level (Pierce et al., 2008; Vaygan et al., 2007).', 'The  second  structural  dimension  regarding  data  governance  organisation  as  specified  by  the  morphology relates to its organisational form.', 'To this question a number of contributions can be found  in literature which – in analogy to research on IT governance (Weill and Ross, 2005) – suggest that a ', 'CDI  Institute, 2006; Khatri and Brown, 2010; Otto and Reichert, 2010; Weber et al., 2009b).', 'Other authors  point  out  that  no  one-and-only  organisational  form  of  data  governance  can  be  determined,  as  data  governance “must support the needs of all the participants across the enterprise” (Loshin, 2007), which  is why very often virtual forms of organisation can be found in practice (Bitterer and Newman, 2007;  Friedman,  2007).', 'Weber  et  al.', 'SLAs).', 'The third structural dimension regarding data governance organisation as specified by the morphology  is  about  Roles  and  Committees.', 'There  have  been  numerous  contributions  on  the  necessity  and  the  responsibilities of data stewards, for example.', 'From all suggestions made in literature, six basic roles  and  committees  can  be  specified.', 'Data  governance  always  requires  a  sponsor  on  the  level  of  the  executive  management  (Bitterer  and  Newman,  2007;  Karel,  2007;  Sarsfield,  2009;  Weber  et  al.,  2009b).', 'The  sponsor  fosters  data  governance  throughout  the  company  and  grants  the  “mandate”  for  action.', 'Since data governance typically affects a company as a whole, quite frequently a so-called data  governance  council  (Cheong  and  Chang,  2007;  Dyché,  2007;  Laurent,  2005;  McGilvray,  2007;  Redman, 2005) can be found, which is supposed to balance and match different interests of different  stakeholders  in  data  management,  and  which  is  also  supposed  to  make  binding  decisions.', 'The  data  governance council is composed of the data owners and the lead data steward.', 'Many authors point out  the  importance  to  distinguish  between  these  two  roles  (Berson  and  Dubov,  2007;  Bitterer  and  Newman, 2007; DAMA,  2009).', 'While data owners are “accountable” for the  immediate  correctness  and consistency of certain data, data stewards develop and provide the rules for the handling of this  data, i.e. they are “responsible” for the overall data management.', 'Bitterer and Newman (2007) use a metaphor to differentiate between the two roles, comparing the data  owner to “a king who owns the land, but does not do anything with it, apart from riding horses on the  land”, whereas the data steward is compared to “a farmer who takes care of the land by growing crops,  watering plants, ploughing fields and so on.” The group of data stewards can be further divided into a  lead data steward and several business data stewards and technical data stewards.', 'For the role of the  lead data steward a number of synonyms are used in literature, such as “corporate data steward” (CDI  Institute, 2006; Russom, 2006) or “chief data officer” (Griffin, 2008).', 'Critical Appraisal ', 'Six  mini  case  studies  (see  Table  4)  are  used  to  assess  the  morphology  of  the  organisation  of  data  governance by means of empirical data from the phenomenon’s natural context.', 'To  some  extent,  the  mini  case  studies  reveal  a  high  level  of  congruence  between  the  goals  and  structures  of  the  cases  analysed  and  the  specifications  of  the  morphology  of  data  governance  organisation.', 'All  manifestations  of  the  data  governance  goals  and the  date  governance  structure,  the  two  major  dimensions  of  the  morphology,  can  be  found  in  the  real-world  cases  as  well.', 'What  the  appraisal also shows is that there is great similarity regarding the manifestations of the two dimensions  across all cases analysed.', 'In all cases, data governance is located on the third or fourth management  level, the functional goals are similar, and the organisational form of the data governance structure is  more or less of a centralised nature.', 'On the other hand, the mini case studies reveal also differences  between the cases analysed and the concepts developed in the morphology.', 'Although data governance  is  considered  to  have  significant  business  impact  on  companies,  a  direct  relation  between  data  governance  and  business  goals  can  only  be  found  in  Case  D  (yet  without  any  goal  quantification).', 'What  can  be  found  are  goals  that  relate  to  data  quality  and  to  service  level  agreements  (SLAs).', 'Another  difference  refers  to  the  involvement  of  the  executive  management  when  it  comes  to  data  governance,  which  is  seen  as  critical  by  authors  from  both  the  scientific  and  the  practitioners’  community, but which cannot be confirmed in any of the six cases.', 'As already mentioned above, the  mandate  for  action  is  located  on  the  middle  management  level.', 'Also,  there  is  no  example  of  data ', 'One possible explanation for this may  be that data governance often refers to the management of corporate data (i.e. data that is used across  the entire company), which seems to be difficult to accomplish by means of a decentralised approach.', 'The  focus  on  corporate  data  is  also  confirmed  by  the  fact  that  four  of  the  six  companies  apply  data  governance  explicitly  for  the  management  of  their  master  data.', 'Finally,  there  is  a  difference  with  regard to the establishment of committees for data governance.', 'Three of the six companies do without  any special committees for data governance, although in literature the importance of committees (data  governance council, for example) is an aspect that is stressed quite frequently.', 'DG

ORGANISATION OF  DATA GOVERNANCE ', 'Otto, Boris, University of St. Gallen, Institute of Information Management, Müller-Friedberg-', 'Strasse 8, 9000 St. Gallen, Switzerland, boris.otto@unisg.ch ', 'Abstract ', 'Both information systems (IS) researchers and practitioners consider data governance as a promising  approach  for  companies  to  improve  and  maintain  the  quality  of  corporate  data,  which  is  seen  as  critical  for  being  able  to  meet  strategic  business  requirements,  such  as  compliance  or  integrated  customer management.', 'Both sides agree that data governance primarily is a matter of organisation.', 'However, hardly any scientific results have been produced so far indicating what actually has to be  organised by data governance, and what data governance may look like.', 'The  paper aims at closing  this  gap  by  developing  a  morphology  of  data  governance  organisation  on  the  basis  of  a  comprehensive analysis of the state of the art both in science and in practice.', 'Epistemologically, the  morphology  represents  an  analytic  theory,  as  it  serves  for  structuring  the  research  topic  of  data  governance, which is still quite unexplored.', 'Six mini case studies are used to evaluate the morphology  by means of empirical data.', 'Providing a foundation for further research, the morphology contributes  to  the  advancement  of  the  scientific  body  of  knowledge.', 'At  the  same  time,  it  is  beneficial  to  practitioners, as companies may use it as a guideline when organising data governance.', 'Keywords: Data governance, Organisational design, Theory development, Morphology.', 'Introduction ', 'Regarding the quality of their data, companies see themselves confronted with a number of strategic  business  requirements,  such  as  compliance  with  legal  and  regulatory  provisions  or  the  need  for  customer centric business models.', 'In this context, data governance is seen as a promising approach for  companies to improve and maintain the quality of their data (Panian, 2010).', 'Early definitions of the  term  have  been  rendered  both  by  researchers  (Khatri  and  Brown,  2010;  Weber  et  al.,  2009b)  and  practitioners (Karel, 2007; Russom, 2006).', 'Both sides agree that data governance refers to the entirety  of decision rights and responsibilities regarding the management of data assets.', 'Assigning decision rights within companies is a typical organisational task (Galbraith, 1974; Grochla,  1982).', 'As  to  the  organisation  of  data  governance,  both  researchers  and  practitioners  have  come  up  with a number of recommendations, such as functional diagrams linking decision rights to appropriate  roles (Dyché and Levy, 2006; McGilvray, 2007; Weber et al., 2009b), specification of roles such as  data stewards or data committees (Economist Intelligence Unit, 2008; Friedman, 2007; Loshin, 2007),  specification of decision rights (Khatri and Brown, 2010; Weber et al., 2009b), or recommendations  for establishing data governance in companies’ organisational structures (Karel, 2007; Vaygan et al.,  2007; Weber et al., 2009b).', 'What all these approaches  have in common is that they focus on single  aspects of data governance, what leads to isolated solutions only.', 'The fact that companies need to take  into account a number of aspects when trying to organise data governance has been neglected so far.', 'This  gap  both  in  the  scientific  and  in  the  practical  state  of  the  art  has  been  the  motivation  for  this  contribution.', 'The research question to be answered is: What are the aspects that need to be considered  in order to capture the entirety of data governance organisation?', 'To  accomplish  this  objective  the  paper  develops  a  morphology  of  data  governance  organisation.', 'In  general, a morphology is concerned with the “structure and arrangement of parts of an object, and how  these  conform  to  create  a  whole”  (Ritchey,  2006,  p.', 'Epistemologically,  a  morphology  follows  the principles of an “analytic theory” as specified by Gregor (2006, p.', 'Theories of this kind  describe the structure and the relations of the basic concepts of current phenomena for which only few  scientific results are available so far.', 'For theory development, a deductive approach (Wilde and Hess,  2006) is applied, based on a detailed analysis of both the scientific and the practical state of the art.', 'In  addition, mini case studies are used for a critical appraisal of the morphology.', 'A similar use of mini  case  studies  has  been  described  by  Weill  and  Olson  (1989)  in  their  investigation  on  investments  in  information technology (IT).', 'Background ', 'As  mentioned  above,  researchers  and  practitioners  agree  that  data  governance  is  basically  about  assigning decision rights and responsibilities when it comes to data management in companies (Karel,  2007; Khatri and Brown, 2010; Russom, 2006; Weber et al., 2009b; Wende and Otto, 2007).', 'It is also  common sense that data governance is of particular importance when it comes to the management of  master data, i.e. data about materials and products, customers and suppliers, for example (Dreibelbis et  al.,  2008;  Loshin,  2008).', 'Furthermore,  practitioners  and  researchers  agree  upon  the  fact  that  establishing  data  governance  is  an  organisational  design  task  (Lee  et  al.,  2006;  Pierce  et  al.,  2008).', 'However, a holistic perspective on the entirety of the several organisational concepts is still missing  with regard to data governance.', 'Therefore, in the following a conceptual framework of the different  dimensions of “organisation” as a theoretical concept is derived from studies on organisational design  in general and on the organisation of the IS function in particular.', 'The  first  organisational  dimension  relates  to  (1)  an  organisation’s  goals.', 'Grochla  (1982)  divides  the  them into (1A) formal goals and (1B) functional goals.', 'Whereas the former measure an organisation’s  performance, the latter refer to the tasks an organisation has to fulfil.', 'Transferred to the research area ', 'The second organisational dimension is (2) the organisational structure (Galbraith, 2002).', 'It comprises  three aspects, namely the positioning of decision-making power within the hierarchical structure of an  organisation (2A, “locus of control”), the division of labour and the (2B) organisational form resulting  from this, and the allocation of tasks to (2C) roles and committees.', 'Especially, the question regarding  the positioning of the “locus of control” with regard to decision-making on IT is a traditional research  area in IS research.', 'Boynton et al.', 'IS/IT  related  decision  rights  between  functional  departments  and  IT  department.', 'In  the  context  of  data  governance  there  have  been  some  basic  reflections about this issue both in the scientific (Khatri and Brown, 2010; Weber et al., 2009b) and in  the practitioners’ community (Friedman, 2007; Laurent, 2005).', 'IS research also has developed a comprehensive knowledge base on the division of labour of the IS/IT  function  and organisational  forms  resulting  from  this.', 'There  have  been  numerous  studies  examining  alternatives in the continuum between centralised and decentralised organisation (Brown, 1997; Ein- Dor  and  Segev,  1978).', 'Based  on  this,  various  researchers  have  determined  contingency  factors  by  transferring the principles of contingency theory to the organisation of the IS/IT function (Brown and  Magill, 1994; Sambamurthy and Zmud, 1999).', 'The so-called IT governance archetypes by Weill and  Ross (2005) are also built upon these studies.', 'Regarding data governance, comparable studies have not  been  made  so  far.', 'Instead,  what  can  be  found  is  a  number  of  organisational  “prototypes”  for  data  governance in certain individual cases (Cheong and Chang, 2007; Dyché and Levy, 2006; Friedman,  2007).', 'Introducing  roles  and  committees  for  data  governance  typically  involves  hierarchy-overarching  and  hierarchy-complementing measures.', 'In organisational design, such measures are the result of an effort  to  mitigate  the  dysfunctional  aspects  of  the  primary  organisation  (Galbraith,  2002;  Lawrence  and  Lorsch,  1967).', 'There  have  been  numerous  suggestions,  particularly  from  the  practitioners’  community, regarding roles and committees to which decision rights and responsibilities are assigned  in  the  course  of  data  governance.', 'Precision  and  unambiguity  of  terms  is  still  insufficient,  though.', 'When elaborating on data stewardship, for example, suggestions range from  “data steward” (Berson  and Dubov, 2007; Loshin, 2007) to “data custodian” (Cheong and Chang, 2007) to “data governance  manager”(McGilvray, 2007) to “chief steward” (Weber et al., 2009b).', 'Research Approach ', 'This  paper  aims  at  the  development  of  a  morphology  of  data  governance  organisation  based  on  deductive  analysis  (cf.', 'Wilde  and  Hess,  2006,  p.', 'Following  the  notion  of  theory  building  as  specified  by  Gregor  (2006),  the  morphology  constitutes  an  analytic  theory,  i.e.  it  identifies  and  structures the basic concepts of data governance organisation.', 'The research approach comprises three  steps.', 'Step  1  started  with  an  analysis  of  the  scientific  literature  related  to  data  governance.', 'Five  academic  online  libraries  were  searched,  namely  the  ACM  Digital  Library,  the  AIS  Electronic  Library,  CiteseerX, EBSCO Online, and Emerald Insight (see Table 1).', 'Data governance was used as a search  term, but also related terms such as “information governance”, “data management organisation”1, and  “information  management  organization”  in  order  to  cover  a  broader  scope.', 'In  addition  to  this,  a  heuristic  search  procedure  using  Google  Scholar  was  applied,  with  “data  governance”  used  as  the  search term.', 'All search results were analysed and categorised according to their nature (scientific or  practice-oriented)

governance (Delbaere and Ferreira, 2007; Ferguson, 2007; Karel, 2007; Otto et al., 2007; Panian,  2010;  Vaygan  et  al.,  2007).', 'Other  sources  do  not  explicitly  refer  to  the  issue  of  compliance,  but  suggest similar concepts to be goals of data governance.', 'The IBM Data Governance Maturity Model,  for example, specifies risk reduction as a goal of data governance (IBM, 2007).', 'Other business goals  refer to decision-making (Dyché, 2007; Ferguson, 2007; Otto et al., 2007; Pierce et al., 2008; Thomas,  2006) and customer satisfaction.', 'Regarding the latter, the CDI Institute speaks of “enhancing customer  loyalty” (2006), while Otto et al.', 'Apart from that, “increasing the operational efficiency” (Vaygan et al., 2007) is specified as a business  goal by the morphology.', 'This goal is supposed to be accomplished by, for example, avoiding process  errors  caused  by  data  defects  or  increasing  process  lead  times  with  the  help  of  consistent  data  (Ferguson, 2007; Thomas, 2006).', 'The fifth business goal relates to “support of business integration”,  which is particularly relevant in the case of company mergers (CDI Institute, 2006).', 'The second set of formal goals specified by the morphology is a two-piece set of IS/IT-related goals:  “increase data quality” (Pierce et al., 2008) and “support IS/IT integration”.', 'Regarding the latter, Karel  points out the importance of data governance in data migration projects (2007).', 'Besides formal goals,  the  morphology  of  data  governance  organisation  specifies  a  number  of  functional  goals.', 'Functional  goals  exclusively  relate  to  the  decision  areas  for  which  data  governance  specifies  certain  rights  and ', 'The first functional goal aims at the creation of a data strategy (DAMA, 2009; Otto  and Reichert, 2010; Otto et al., 2007; Pierce et al., 2008) and of data policies (DAMA, 2009; Griffin,  2006;  Khatri  and  Brown,  2010).', 'The  two  terms  have  been  distinguished  by  DAMA  International,  saying that data strategy refers to a “high-level course of action” of data management, whereas data  policies  rather  comprise  concise  principles  and  rules  of  behaviour  (DAMA,  2009).', 'A  second  functional  goal  refers  to  the  establishment  of  data  quality  controlling  using  data  quality  metrics  (Friedman, 2007; Griffin, 2006; IBM, 2007; Khatri and Brown, 2010; McGilvray, 2007; Vaygan et al.,  2007; White et al., 2008).', 'More functional goals relate to the establishment of data stewardship, data

'Morphology of Data Governance Organisation.', 'The  second  dimension  of  the  morphology  of  data  governance  organisation  is  its  structure.', 'The  first  aspect here refers to the “locus of control”, i.e. the main instance of responsibility for data governance  in a company.', 'Relevant sources have been discussing two questions with regard to the positioning of  the  locus  of  control:  its  functional  positioning  and  its  positioning  in  a  company’s  hierarchical  structure.', 'While  some  authors  see  the  functional  positioning  of  the  locus  of  control  in  business  departments  (Cheong  and  Chang,  2007;  Friedman,  2007;  NCC,  2006),  others  prefer  the  locus  of  control  to  be  in  a  company’s  IS/IT  department  (CDI  Institute,  2006;  Delbaere  and  Ferreira,  2007).', 'Quite  often,  however,  there  are  many  authors  suggesting  that  some  kind  of  shared  responsibility  should be established for data governance.', 'As Seiner (Seiner, 2007) puts it: “When I get asked if Data  Governance  should  ‘reside’  in  the  business  areas  or  the  IT  area,  my  answer  is  always  ...', 'Yes’.', 'It  should  reside  in  both.”  Regarding  the  hierarchical  positioning  of  the  locus  of  control  for  data  governance,  also  no  clear  trend  can  be  identified  when  looking  at  the  opinions  of  relevant  authors.', 'Many of them suggest data governance to be located both on the executive management level and on  the middle management level (Pierce et al., 2008; Vaygan et al., 2007).', 'The  second  structural  dimension  regarding  data  governance  organisation  as  specified  by  the  morphology relates to its organisational form.', 'To this question a number of contributions can be found  in literature which – in analogy to research on IT governance (Weill and Ross, 2005) – suggest that a ', 'CDI  Institute, 2006; Khatri and Brown, 2010; Otto and Reichert, 2010; Weber et al., 2009b).', 'Other authors  point  out  that  no  one-and-only  organisational  form  of  data  governance  can  be  determined,  as  data  governance “must support the needs of all the participants across the enterprise” (Loshin, 2007), which  is why very often virtual forms of organisation can be found in practice (Bitterer and Newman, 2007;  Friedman,  2007).', 'Weber  et  al.', 'SLAs).', 'The third structural dimension regarding data governance organisation as specified by the morphology  is  about  Roles  and  Committees.', 'There  have  been  numerous  contributions  on  the  necessity  and  the  responsibilities of data stewards, for example.', 'From all suggestions made in literature, six basic roles  and  committees  can  be  specified.', 'Data  governance  always  requires  a  sponsor  on  the  level  of  the  executive  management  (Bitterer  and  Newman,  2007;  Karel,  2007;  Sarsfield,  2009;  Weber  et  al.,  2009b).', 'The  sponsor  fosters  data  governance  throughout  the  company  and  grants  the  “mandate”  for  action.', 'Since data governance typically affects a company as a whole, quite frequently a so-called data  governance  council  (Cheong  and  Chang,  2007;  Dyché,  2007;  Laurent,  2005;  McGilvray,  2007;  Redman, 2005) can be found, which is supposed to balance and match different interests of different  stakeholders  in  data  management,  and  which  is  also  supposed  to  make  binding  decisions.', 'The  data  governance council is composed of the data owners and the lead data steward.', 'Many authors point out  the  importance  to  distinguish  between  these  two  roles  (Berson  and  Dubov,  2007;  Bitterer  and  Newman, 2007; DAMA,  2009).', 'While data owners are “accountable” for the  immediate  correctness  and consistency of certain data, data stewards develop and provide the rules for the handling of this  data, i.e. they are “responsible” for the overall data management.', 'Bitterer and Newman (2007) use a metaphor to differentiate between the two roles, comparing the data  owner to “a king who owns the land, but does not do anything with it, apart from riding horses on the  land”, whereas the data steward is compared to “a farmer who takes care of the land by growing crops,  watering plants, ploughing fields and so on.” The group of data stewards can be further divided into a  lead data steward and several business data stewards and technical data stewards.', 'For the role of the  lead data steward a number of synonyms are used in literature, such as “corporate data steward” (CDI  Institute, 2006; Russom, 2006) or “chief data officer” (Griffin, 2008).', 'Critical Appraisal ', 'Six  mini  case  studies  (see  Table  4)  are  used  to  assess  the  morphology  of  the  organisation  of  data  governance by means of empirical data from the phenomenon’s natural context.', 'To  some  extent,  the  mini  case  studies  reveal  a  high  level  of  congruence  between  the  goals  and  structures  of  the  cases  analysed  and  the  specifications  of  the  morphology  of  data  governance  organisation.', 'All  manifestations  of  the  data  governance  goals  and the  date  governance  structure,  the  two  major  dimensions  of  the  morphology,  can  be  found  in  the  real-world  cases  as  well.', 'What  the  appraisal also shows is that there is great similarity regarding the manifestations of the two dimensions  across all cases analysed.', 'In all cases, data governance is located on the third or fourth management  level, the functional goals are similar, and the organisational form of the data governance structure is  more or less of a centralised nature.', 'On the other hand, the mini case studies reveal also differences  between the cases analysed and the concepts developed in the morphology.', 'Although data governance  is  considered  to  have  significant  business  impact  on  companies,  a  direct  relation  between  data  governance  and  business  goals  can  only  be  found  in  Case  D  (yet  without  any  goal  quantification).', 'What  can  be  found  are  goals  that  relate  to  data  quality  and  to  service  level  agreements  (SLAs).', 'Another  difference  refers  to  the  involvement  of  the  executive  management  when  it  comes  to  data  governance,  which  is  seen  as  critical  by  authors  from  both  the  scientific  and  the  practitioners’  community, but which cannot be confirmed in any of the six cases.', 'As already mentioned above, the  mandate  for  action  is  located  on  the  middle  management  level.', 'Also,  there  is  no  example  of  data ', 'One possible explanation for this may  be that data governance often refers to the management of corporate data (i.e. data that is used across  the entire company), which seems to be difficult to accomplish by means of a decentralised approach.', 'The  focus  on  corporate  data  is  also  confirmed  by  the  fact  that  four  of  the  six  companies  apply  data  governance  explicitly  for  the  management  of  their  master  data.', 'Finally,  there  is  a  difference  with  regard to the establishment of committees for data governance.', 'Three of the six companies do without  any special committees for data governance, although in literature the importance of committees (data  governance council, for example) is an aspect that is stressed quite frequently.', 'DG

analytic theory that serves for structuring the research topic of data governance, an area for which  only  few  scientific  findings  have  been  produced  so  far.', 'The  morphology  contributes  to  the  advancement of the scientific state of the art by forming a basis for further studies.', 'For example, the  morphology  allows  identifying  and  evaluating  “archetypes”  of  data  governance  and  it  allows  for  detailed  analysis  of  contingency  factors.', 'The  practitioners’  community  will  also  benefit  from  the  morphology, as it is structuring a complex phenomenon for which only isolated solutions have been  proposed  so  far.', 'Companies  that  want  to  organise  data  governance  can  use  the  morphology  as  a  guideline or checklist.', 'Limitations of the paper lie in the nature of analytic theories (cf.', 'Gregor, 2006).', 'Analytic theories form only a starting point for future research.', 'The next research steps could include,  for example, investigations into the impact of the model on the design of data governance organisation  and quantitative analyses of the archetypes mentioned above.', 'References ', 'Ardagna, C.', 'A., De Capitani

and limited opportunities for benefit-sharing have focused  attention on the tension that Indigenous communities feel between (1) protecting Indigenous  rights and interests in Indigenous data (including traditional knowledges) and (2)\\xa0 supporting  open  data,  machine  learning,  broad  data  sharing,  and  big  data  initiatives.', 'The  International  Indigenous Data Sovereignty Interest Group (within the Research Data Alliance) is a network  of nation-state based Indigenous data sovereignty networks and individuals that developed the  ‘CARE  Principles  for  Indigenous  Data  Governance’  (Collective  Benefit,  Authority  to  Control,  Responsibility, and Ethics) in consultation with Indigenous Peoples, scholars, non-profit organi- zations, and governments.', 'The CARE Principles are people– and purpose-oriented, reflecting the  crucial role of data in advancing innovation, governance, and self-determination among Indig- enous Peoples.', 'The Principles complement the existing data-centric approach represented in  the ‘FAIR Guiding Principles for scientific data management and stewardship’ (Findable, Acces- sible,  Interoperable,  Reusable).', 'The  CARE  Principles  build  upon  earlier  work  by  the  Te  Mana  Raraunga Maori Data Sovereignty Network, US Indigenous Data Sovereignty Network, Maiam  nayri Wingara Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Data Sovereignty Collective, and numerous  Indigenous Peoples, nations, and communities.', 'The goal is that stewards and other users of  Indigenous data will ‘Be FAIR and CARE.’ In this first formal publication of the CARE Principles,  we articulate their rationale, describe their relation to the FAIR Principles, and present exam- ples of their application.', 'Keywords: Indigenous; data sovereignty; data governance; data principles; FAIR principles', 'Introduction As the world engages with open data, big data, data reuse, and open science, data have increasingly become  a global resource used for wielding power, making decisions, spurring innovation and discovery, and com- mercialization (Independent Expert Advisory Group 2014, The Economist 2017).', 'The effects of this shift are ', 'Art.', 'Historically plagued by data inequities and  data exploitation, Indigenous Peoples have raised concerns about the need to integrate Indigenous knowl- edges and approaches into data practices and policies as both the volume and opportunities for secondary  use of data increase (Jackson et al.', 'Kukutai & Cormack 2019; Carroll et al.', 'Garrison et al.', 'Rainie et al.', 'Kukutai & Taylor 2016b).', 'The articulation of Indigenous Peoples’ rights and interests in  data about their peoples, communities, cultures, and territories is part of reclaiming control of data, data  ecosystems, data science, and data narratives in the context of open data and open science.', 'Control, coupled  with  a  focus  on  collective  benefit  and  equity,  repositions  Indigenous  Peoples,  nations,  and  communities  from being subjects of data that perpetuate unequal power distributions to self-determining users of data  for development and wellbeing.', 'Harnessing data for governance and acting in the governance of data, shifts  Indigenous Peoples from invisibility within data ecosystems to vibrant contributors to data policies, prac- tices, ethics, and innovation.', 'Leveraging Indigenous Rights for Indigenous Data Futures Background Global Indigenous presence spans over 90 countries and includes over 370 million Indigenous persons living  out more than 5,000 distinct cultures (UN 2009).', 'Indigenous Peoples have continuity with their pre-colonial  societies and seek to use their own social, political, and economic systems to preserve, develop, and trans- mit to future generations their cultures, knowledges, and relationships with their territories and resources  (Martinez Cobo 1982).', 'While often limited by settler-colonial oppression and definition, Indigenous Peoples  retain their rights to self-determine their forms of collective governance and rules of membership.', 'In  the  contemporary  world,  Indigenous  Peoples  and  nations,  people,  and  communities  have  become  actors across global societies.', 'Indigenous Peoples and their nations are the rightsholders as affirmed by the  United Nations and nation-state legal recognition of Indigenous sovereignty (Echo-Hawk 2013; UN 2007;  Anaya  2004).', 'Indigenous  Peoples  as  sovereign  political  collectives  often  participate  in  supra-  and  inter- tribal organizations such as the Oceti Sakowin Oyate and the Iwi Chairs’ Forum, and have local or regional  sub-systems such as Tohono O’Odham districts in the US and the Federation of Victorian Traditional Owner  Corporations in Australia.', 'Indigenous people often live as citizens of nations (Indigenous) within nations  (the nation state, e.g., the United States).', 'Indigenous people also participate in other Indigenous stakeholder  groups that do not hold inherent sovereignty, including daily life within Indigenous communities (groups of  individuals) within their nations or mainstream society and interaction with Indigenous organizations such  as health care entities, non-profits, and businesses.', 'Ongoing  processes  of  colonization  of  Indigenous  Peoples  and  globalization  of  Western  ideas,  values,  and lifestyles have resulted in epistemicide, the suppression and co-optation of Indigenous knowledges  and data systems (Carroll, Rodriguez-Lonebear & Martinez 2019; Kukutai & Taylor 2016a; Kukutai & Walter  2015; Smith 2012).', 'These processes have limited the ability of Indigenous Peoples to recover, develop, and  sustain their knowledges, an ability that is central to Indigenous Peoples’ capacity to realize their human  rights and fulfil their responsibilities (Wilson, 2004; Ratima 2001).', 'Alongside  Indigenous  aspirations  for  self-determination,  social  justice  movements  have  promoted  the  importance of equity within society and become more deliberate about addressing the negative effects of  unconscious bias and structural racism.', 'The pervasiveness of bias across data ecosystems (digital infrastruc- tures, analytics, and applications), within sub-systems (regions/platforms), as well as institutions and com- munities indicate the importance of addressing inequities at multiple levels.', 'Indigenous people recognize  and already incorporate this multi-scale complexity in their knowledge systems and activities; however, this  may not be the case for other communities of practice, or knowledge systems.', 'The Emergence of Indigenous Data Sovereignty Since the 1970s, there has been a resurgence in discourse around Indigenous knowledges, identities, and  rights, culminating in the 2007 United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples [UNDRIP]  (UN 2007).', 'UNDRIP reaffirms Indigenous Peoples’ rights to self-determination as political entities and hon- ors the principle of Indigenous control over Indigenous data (Tsosie 2019; Davis 2016).', 'The rights articulated  in UNDRIP (especially Article 31) also reflect discourse around Indigenous Cultural and Intellectual Property  Rights (ICIP) and Indigenous research ethics (Mātaatua Declaration 1993; Julayinbul Statement 1993; Janke  1998, 2004; Drugge 2016; Tsosie 1997, 2019; Anderson 2009, 2015).', 'UNDRIP reflects a broad approach to ', 'Carroll et al: The CARE Principles for Indigenous Data Governance\\x0cArt.', 'Indigenous data that is not restricted by mainstream conceptions of knowledge and intellectual property  (Posey & Dutfield, 1996).', 'Indigenous Peoples’ data include data generated by Indigenous Peoples, as well as by governments and other  institutions, on and about Indigenous Peoples and territories.', 'As well as information about Indigenous com- munities and the individuals, Indigenous and non-Indigenous, that live within (Carroll,  Rodriguez-Lonebear  &  Martinez  2019;  Rainie  et  al.', 'MnW  2018;  Nickerson  2017;  TMR  2016).', 'Indigenous  Peoples’  data   comprise (1) information and knowledge about the environment, lands, skies, resources, and non-humans  with which they have relations; (2) information about Indigenous persons such as administrative, census,  health, social, commercial, and corporate and, (3) information and knowledge about Indigenous Peoples  as collectives, including traditional and cultural information, oral histories, ancestral and clan knowledge,  cultural sites, and stories, belongings.', 'The  advancement  of  Indigenous  self-determination  and  the  reclamation  of  Indigenous  identity  and  knowledges over the past 50 years has led to the emergence of Indigenous Data Sovereignty, an assertion  of the rights and interests of Indigenous Peoples in relation to data about them, their territories, and their  ways  of  life  (Carroll,  Rodriguez-Lonebear  &  Martinez  2019;  Rainie  et  al.', 'Kukutai  &  Taylor  2016a;  Snipp  2016).', 'Indigenous  Data  Sovereignty  has  become  an  increasingly  relevant  topic  as  big  data,  open  data, open science, and data reuse become an integral part of research and institutional practices (Carroll,  Rodriguez-Lonebear & Martinez 2019; Lovett et al.', 'Rainie et al.', 'Kukutai & Taylor 2016a; Taylor  & Kukutai 2015).', 'Given that most Indigenous data are held by non-Indigenous governments, institutions,  and agencies, increasing Indigenous Peoples’ participation in data governance activities is central to realiz- ing Indigenous Data Sovereignty (Carroll, Rodriguez-Lonebear & Martinez 2019; Rainie et al.', 'Kukutai  & Taylor 2016b; Rodriguez-Lonebear 2016; Smith 2016; Snipp 2016).', 'Indigenous data governance includes  both  the  stewardship  and  the  processes  necessary  to  implement  Indigenous  control  over  Indigenous  data (collection, storage, analysis, use, reuse) (Carroll, Rodriguez-Lonebear & Martinez 2019; Rainie et al.', 'Walter 2018; Rodriguez-Lonebear 2016; Smith 2016).', 'The development of conceptual frameworks  to  inform  processes  for  stewardship  and  control  of  Indigenous  data  has  been  ongoing  in  areas  such  as   science, research methods, and research governance (Cajete, 2000; Wilson, 2008; Kovach, 2009; McGregor,  Restoule & Johnston, 2018).', 'There is a need to apply insights generated from these frameworks within data  ecosystems to help address the challenge of producing data that reflect Indigenous Peoples’ interests and  governance needs.', 'The Care Principles Rationale  Mainstream values related to research and data are often inconsistent with Indigenous cultures and collec- tive rights.', 'For instance, data historically belonged to the researcher in mainstream settings, a notion that  has shifted under open data and open science movements where publicly funded research requires data  sharing.', 'Meanwhile, Indigenous worldviews have typically centered ‘people’ and ‘purpose’ through govern- ance  processes  that  emphasize  collective  ownership  and  control  of  data  (Carroll,  Rodriguez-Lonebear  &  Martinez 2019; Kukutai & Taylor 2016b; Smith 2016; Snipp 2016).', 'Indigenous Peoples have been working  on ways to authenticate Indigenous forms of knowledge and to fortify their rights to govern research and  resulting data (Garrison et al.', 'Hudson et al.', 'Smith 2012).', 'Drawing on the First Nations principles of OCAP® that created data standards for Ownership, Control,  Access,  and  Possession  in  Canada  in  the  1990s  (FNIGC  2019),  Indigenous  Data  Sovereignty  networks  in  Aotearoa New Zealand, Australia, and the United States, as well as Indigenous scholars, leaders, and allies,  determined that there was an urgent need to develop global principles for the governance of Indigenous  data.', 'Underlying this need were the primary goals of (1) fostering Indigenous self-determination by enhanc- ing Indigenous use of data for Indigenous pursuits and (2) honoring the ‘FAIR Guiding Principles for  scientific  data management and stewardship’ (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) (Wilkinson et al.', 'Indigenous terms.', 'The  ‘CARE  Principles  for  Indigenous  Data  Governance’  (Collective  Benefit,  Authority  to  Control,  Responsibility, and Ethics) (RDA IG 2019) empower Indigenous Peoples by shifting the focus from regulated  consultation  to  value-based  relationships  that  position  data  approaches  within  Indigenous  cultures  and  knowledge systems to the benefit of Indigenous Peoples (Castellano 2004; Anderson et al.', 'This shift  ultimately promotes equitable participation in processes of data reuse, which will result in more equitable  outcomes.', 'Carroll et al: The CARE Principles for Indigenous Data Governance\\x0cArt.', 'Development Academics and practitioners in the International Indigenous Data Sovereignty Interest Group within the  Research Data Alliance (RDA 2017) acknowledged the tension between protecting Indigenous rights and  interests in data and supporting open data.', 'With this challenge in mind, a workshop was held in Gaborone,  Botswana, on Indigenous Data Sovereignty as part of International Data Week in 2018.', 'This Indigenous-led  workshop convened Indigenous and allied academics and practitioners to draft principles for Indigenous  data governance.', 'Workshop organizers prepared an analysis of principles from frameworks issued by Indig- enous Data Sovereignty and governance networks, as well as by mainstream sources, to inform dialogue  (Table 1).', 'Table 1: Key Documents Contributing to the Development of the CARE Principles.',

Charter Principles (ODC 2015)', 'FAIR Guiding Principles for scientific data management and stewardship  (Wilkinson et al.', 'STREAM properties for industrial and commoditized data (Demchenko et al.', 'Participants  concluded  that  existing  frameworks  were  oriented  toward  data,  people,  and  purpose  (see  Figure  1).', 'While  both  Indigenous  and  mainstream  principles  identified  data-centric  principles  (such  as  those named in the FAIR Principles), the Indigenous frameworks emphasized people- and purpose-oriented  principles.', 'Figure 1: Indigenous and Mainstream Data Principles, and Orientation toward Data, People, and Purpose.', 'Carroll et al: The CARE Principles for Indigenous Data Governance\\x0cArt.', 'Workshop participants felt that the mainstream frameworks adequately covered data-centric principles  and focused their attention on the ‘people’ and ‘purpose’ foci of the Indigenous principles to create the CARE  Principles.', 'Once the four primary CARE Principles of Collective benefit, Authority to control, Responsibility,  and Ethics were identified, participants broke into small groups to outline and draft the language for both  primary  and  sub-principles.', 'The  resulting  draft  was  shared  among  nation-state  based  network  members,  Indigenous leaders, Indigenous scholars, and allies for input (edits, revisions, comments, feedback) via elec- tronic media, presentations, and engagements.', 'The CARE Principles are designed to complement the FAIR Principles and guide the inclusion of Indigenous  Peoples in data processes that strengthen Indigenous control for improved discovery, access, use, reuse, and  attribution in contemporary data landscapes.', 'Exposition  The CARE Principles address important considerations for modern data ecosystems and across data lifecycles  that support both innovation and Indigenous self-determination (Figure 2).', 'The Principles describe high- level actions applicable within research, government, and institutional data settings.', 'The goal is for data  stewards and other users of Indigenous data to implement CARE and FAIR Principles in tandem.', 'While each is conceptually distinct, the CARE Principles are related to each other.', 'The Principles define  rights,  interests,  and  concepts  to  be  employed  in  facilitating  Indigenous  control  in  data  governance  and  reuse.', 'An  enacted  mechanism  can  address  a  single  Principle  or  multiple  simultaneously.', 'However,  data   governance must address the full set of Principles to demonstrate a CARE Full process.', 'Figure 2: The CARE Principles for Indigenous Data Governance.', 'Carroll et al: The CARE Principles for Indigenous Data Governance\\x0cArt.', 'The CARE Principles and Their Supporting Concepts Indigenous data must facilitate collective benefit for Indigenous Peoples to achieve inclusive development  and  innovation,  improve  governance  and  citizen  engagement,  and  realize  equitable  outcomes.', 'Benefits  accrue when data ecosystems are designed and function to support (1) Indigenous nation and community  use and reuse of data; (2) use of data for policy decisions and evaluation of services; and (3) creation and use  of data that reflect community values.', 'UNDRIP affirms Indigenous Peoples’ rights and interests in their data.', 'Recognition of these rights bolsters  Indigenous Peoples’ authority to control and govern such data, further affirming the need for ‘data for  governance.’ Indigenous Peoples must have access to data that support Indigenous governance and self- determination.', 'Indigenous Peoples must be the ones to determine data governance protocols, while being  actively involved in stewardship decisions for Indigenous data that are held by other entities.', 'When working with Indigenous data, there is a responsibility to nurture respectful relationships with  Indigenous Peoples from whom the data originate.', 'Aspects of the relationship include investing in capacity  development, increasing community data capabilities, and embedding data within Indigenous languages  and cultures.', 'Pursuing these goals fulfills the ultimate responsibility of supporting Indigenous data that  advances Indigenous Peoples’ self-determination and collective benefit.', 'Indigenous  Peoples’  rights  and  wellbeing  should  be  the  focus  across  data  ecosystems  and  throughout  data  lifecycles  in  order  to  minimize  harm,  maximize  benefits,  promote  justice,  and  allow  for  future  use.', 'Paramount to ethics in data practices is representation and participation of Indigenous Peoples, who must  be the ones to assess benefits, harms, and potential future uses based on community values and ethics.', 'The CARE Principles in Action The usefulness of high-level Indigenous data governance principles relies on both Indigenous communities  and research/data communities to understand operative concepts and to apply them preemptively across  data  ecosystems  and  lifecycles.', 'Creating  opportunities  for  non-Indigenous  understanding  and  for  Indig- enous leadership in data processes will contribute to the development of data and data systems that can lead  to Indigenous innovation and development.', 'Early Adopters of the CARE Principles  Defining principles is an important step toward exercising Indigenous Data Sovereignty and addressing long- standing concerns about data governance.', 'Some organizations are adopting the CARE Principles through  relationships,  policies,  and  mechanisms.', 'Examples  include  the  Research  Data  Alliance,  the  Smithsonian  Institution, and the Open Data Charter.', 'Research Data Alliance (www.rd-alliance.org), in research environments In 2016, the Research Data Alliance (RDA) hosted a workshop on Indigenous Data Sovereignty.', 'Recogniz- ing  the  importance  of  enhancing  Indigenous  rights  and  interests  in  data  and  potential  implications  for  mainstream data policy, the RDA supported the creation of the International Indigenous Data Sovereignty  Interest Group (IG).', 'The IG convenes existing Indigenous Data Sovereignty networks with other Indigenous  and allied researchers, which has resulted in broader global connections, a deeper focus on research data,  and the CARE Principles (Lovett et al.', 'Rainie et al.', 'RDA IG 2019; RDA 2017).', 'In further support of  the IG and the CARE Principles, the RDA formally affiliated with the Global Indigenous Data Alliance (GIDA),  which hosts the Principles.', 'The affiliation affirms the importance of both CARE and GIDA, and represents an  effort to promote implementation of the Principles throughout the RDA community (RDA 2019).', 'The Smithsonian Institution (www.si.edu), in collections environments In  2012,  the  American  Museum  of  Natural  History  at  the  Smithsonian  Institution  in  Washington,  DC  released  an  Access  and  Benefit  Sharing  Policy  on  Genetic  Resources  in  response  to  the  Nagoya  Protocol  (2010) addressing Indigenous expectations around benefit sharing, prior informed consent, and mutually  agreed terms for collections that it stewards (UN 2011; SI 2012).', 'Subsequently, the US government released  the new Open Access to Research Policy in 2013 as an important step in providing unprecedented access to  research and data (Stebbins 2013).', 'However, this policy (and others like it) treats all data in the same way:  without attention to the nature, the content, or the conditions under which the data was created in the first  place (Creative Commons 2019, Wikimedia 2019).', 'In December 2019, Smithsonian Directive 609 was released (SI 2019).', 'With specific focus on digital asset  access and use, it sets forth Smithsonian policy for access and use of Smithsonian digital assets ahead of the ', 'Carroll et al: The CARE Principles for Indigenous Data Governance\\x0cArt.', 'Open Access Statement, in February 2020.', 'The SD 609 is important,  because it helps identify specific categories of material that might need more attention and care in their  management.', 'One of these includes sensitive content, which is: ', 'Such materials may: a) be considered the private domain of specific individuals, clans,  cults or societies; b) require an appropriate level of knowledge to view and understand; c) threaten  the privacy and well-being of a community when exposed or disclosed to outsiders; and/or d) give  offense  if  inappropriately  used  or  displayed,  or  when  appropriated  or  exploited  for  commercial  purposes.', 'SD 609 Restriction Code: .', 'SI 2019)', 'This identification offers an important opportunity to further explore the incorporation of the CARE Prin- ciples into the Smithsonian’s imminent Open Access policy.', 'Recognizing complexity within Smithsonian  digital assets and accompanying metadata, the CARE Principles would add an important layer of relational  and temporal governance for Indigenous collections within an open access logic.', 'Additionally, there are  further opportunities for the CARE Principles to be directly extended into collection management practices.', 'For example, work is about to begin to develop a unique set of ‘Collection CARE Notices’ for Indigenous  collections at the Smithsonian and then into other US institutional contexts.', 'Extending the current Cul- tural Institution Notices developed by Local Contexts (LC 2018), these new Notices will reflect inherent  relationships  of  care,  responsibility  and  governance  in  collection  stewardship  within  the  institution.', 'As  they  are  developed,  these  Notices  will  integrate  the  CARE  Principles  directly,  embedding  these  into  the  Smithsonian’s  cataloguing  and  digital  infrastructure  for  Indigenous  collections.', 'By  providing  item-  and  collection-specific information, the Collection CARE Notices will function as a direct mechanism to assist in  management and decision-making consistent with CARE Principles.', 'Open Data Charter (opendatacharter.net), in government environments After release of the CARE Principles, the Open Data Charter (ODC) Implementation Working Group hosted  a conversation on the Principles (Stone and Calderon 2019).', 'Discussion focused on implementation mecha- nisms as well as resonance among ODC, FAIR, and CARE Principles (Figure 3).', 'While ODC Principles reflect  all four FAIR Principles, they directly address only the CARE Principle of ‘Collective benefit.’ The ODC Prin- ciple of ‘Open by default’ does not directly map to the FAIR or CARE Principles.', 'During a review of ODC  Principles in 2018, open data community members hotly debated ‘Open by default,’ showing a broad range  of interpretations ranging from construing ‘Open by default’ as a key tenet of open data to considering the  principle as tough to define and operationalize (Stone and Calderon 2019).', 'The CARE Principles can help  refine  and  specify  what  ‘Open  by  default’  means  by  (1)  ensuring  roles  for  Indigenous  Peoples  and  other ', 'Figure 3: The Overlap Between the CARE and FAIR Principles and the Open Data Charter.', 'Carroll et al: The CARE Principles for Indigenous Data Governance\\x0cArt.', 'While implementation has commenced in these examples and elsewhere, further research is needed (1) to  identify mechanisms that support implementation of the CARE Principles; (2) to create tools, policies, and  practices that enact the Principles; (3) to explore the application of the Principles in different contexts, such  as research repositories, knowledge co-production, institutional policies and practices, and, retrospectively,  in already existing databases and systems; and (4) to operationalize the Principles in tandem with the FAIR  Principles.', 'Conclusion Being CARE Full is a prerequisite for equitable data and data practices.', 'The CARE Principles draw from, inte- grate, and build on the work of mainstream stakeholders focused on data for reuse (e.g., FAIR Principles) and  the efforts of Indigenous-led networks and coalitions focused on Indigenous data governance and research  control.', 'While centering data in the FAIR Principles complements other efforts to inform responsibilities  for data producers and repositories, the CARE Principles extend that work to actions that align with the  ‘people’ and ‘purpose’ for which data exist and are used.', 'As the mainstream community of data stakeholders  advances standards and practices to facilitate data reuse and research reproducibility, the CARE Principles  enhance that work by reversing historical power imbalances.', 'The CARE Principles address historical inequi- ties by creating value from Indigenous data in ways that are grounded in Indigenous worldviews and by  realizing opportunities for Indigenous Peoples within the knowledge economy.', 'In addition, increasingly robust management and stewardship frameworks for Indigenous digital resources  to the benefit of Indigenous Peoples have broader implications for other marginalized populations, high- lighting the importance of local and group control for the quality and reproducibility of research and data  (Rainie et al.', 'Furthermore, the CARE Principles address issues of relevance for many populations (e.g.,  privacy, future use, reuse, stewardship), to the extent that the Principles provide a normative foundation for  setting standards, crafting policy, and developing research agendas in relation to data acquired about popu- lations as collectives.', 'Those populations might be minority groups, distinctive communities, or other collec- tives wanting to maintain high levels of trust and accountability in the use of data about their communities.', 'The implementation of the CARE Principles in tandem with the FAIR Principles will result in data that  reflect the realities of Indigenous Peoples, be useful for Indigenous purposes, and remain under Indigenous  control, while promoting knowledge discovery and innovation.', 'The CARE Principles are a guide for data pro- ducers, stewards, and publishers to affirm Indigenous rights to self-determination through CARE Full data  practices that will ultimately address complex issues related to privacy, future use, and collective interests,  and increase the value of data for reuse.', 'Just as the FAIR Principles are a precursor to good data management  and stewardship practices, the CARE Principles encourage data users to be FAIR and CARE.', 'Acknowledgements The  original  workshop  “Indigenous  Data  Sovereignty  Principles  for  the  Governance  of  Indigenous  Data,”  was organized by Stephanie Russo

for benefit-sharing have focused  attention on the tension that Indigenous communities feel between (1) protecting Indigenous  rights and interests in Indigenous data (including traditional knowledges) and (2)\\xa0 supporting  open  data,  machine  learning,  broad  data  sharing,  and  big  data  initiatives.', 'The  International  Indigenous Data Sovereignty Interest Group (within the Research Data Alliance) is a network  of nation-state based Indigenous data sovereignty networks and individuals that developed the  ‘CARE  Principles  for  Indigenous  Data  Governance’  (Collective  Benefit,  Authority  to  Control,  Responsibility, and Ethics) in consultation with Indigenous Peoples, scholars, non-profit organi- zations, and governments.', 'The CARE Principles are people– and

wielding power, making decisions, spurring innovation and discovery, and com- mercialization (Independent Expert Advisory Group 2014, The Economist 2017).', 'The effects of this shift are ', 'Art.', 'Historically plagued by data inequities and  data exploitation, Indigenous Peoples have raised concerns about the need to integrate Indigenous knowl- edges and approaches into data practices and policies as both the volume and opportunities for secondary  use of data increase (Jackson et al.', 'Kukutai & Cormack 2019; Carroll et al.', 'Garrison et al.', 'Rainie et al.', 'Kukutai & Taylor 2016b).', 'The articulation of Indigenous Peoples’ rights and interests in  data about their peoples, communities, cultures, and territories is part of reclaiming control of data, data  ecosystems, data science, and data narratives in the context of open data and open science.', 'Control, coupled  with  a  focus  on  collective  benefit  and  equity,  repositions  Indigenous  Peoples,  nations,  and  communities  from being subjects of data that perpetuate unequal power distributions to self-determining users of data  for development and wellbeing.', 'Harnessing data for governance and acting in the governance of data, shifts  Indigenous Peoples from invisibility within data ecosystems to vibrant contributors to data policies, prac- tices, ethics, and innovation.', 'Leveraging Indigenous Rights for Indigenous Data Futures Background Global Indigenous presence spans over 90 countries and includes over 370 million Indigenous persons living  out more than 5,000 distinct cultures (UN 2009).', 'Indigenous Peoples have continuity with their pre-colonial  societies and seek to use their own social, political, and economic systems to preserve, develop, and trans- mit to future generations their cultures, knowledges, and relationships with their territories and resources  (Martinez Cobo 1982).', 'While often limited by settler-colonial oppression and definition, Indigenous Peoples  retain their rights to self-determine their forms of collective governance and rules of membership.', 'In  the  contemporary  world,  Indigenous  Peoples  and  nations,  people,  and  communities  have  become  actors across global societies.', 'Indigenous Peoples and their nations are the rightsholders as affirmed by the  United Nations and nation-state legal recognition of Indigenous sovereignty (Echo-Hawk 2013; UN 2007;  Anaya  2004).', 'Indigenous  Peoples  as  sovereign  political  collectives  often  participate  in  supra-  and  inter- tribal organizations such as the Oceti Sakowin Oyate and the Iwi Chairs’ Forum, and have local or regional  sub-systems such as Tohono O’Odham districts in the US and the Federation of Victorian Traditional Owner  Corporations in Australia.', 'Indigenous people often live as citizens of nations (Indigenous) within nations  (the nation state, e.g., the United States).', 'Indigenous people also participate in other Indigenous stakeholder  groups that do not hold inherent sovereignty, including daily life within Indigenous communities (groups of  individuals) within their nations or mainstream society and interaction with Indigenous organizations such  as health care entities, non-profits, and businesses.', 'Ongoing  processes  of  colonization  of  Indigenous  Peoples  and  globalization  of  Western  ideas,  values,  and lifestyles have resulted in epistemicide, the suppression and co-optation of Indigenous knowledges  and data systems (Carroll, Rodriguez-Lonebear & Martinez 2019; Kukutai & Taylor 2016a; Kukutai & Walter  2015; Smith 2012).', 'These processes have limited the ability of Indigenous Peoples to recover, develop, and  sustain their knowledges, an ability that is central to Indigenous Peoples’ capacity to realize their human  rights and fulfil their responsibilities (Wilson, 2004; Ratima 2001).', 'Alongside  Indigenous  aspirations  for  self-determination,  social  justice  movements  have  promoted  the  importance of equity within society and become more deliberate about addressing the negative effects of  unconscious bias and structural racism.', 'The pervasiveness of bias across data ecosystems (digital infrastruc- tures, analytics, and applications), within sub-systems (regions/platforms), as well as institutions and com- munities indicate the importance of addressing inequities at multiple levels.', 'Indigenous people recognize  and already incorporate this multi-scale complexity in their knowledge systems and activities; however, this  may not be the case for other communities of practice, or knowledge systems.', 'The Emergence of Indigenous Data Sovereignty Since the 1970s, there has been a resurgence in discourse around Indigenous knowledges, identities, and  rights, culminating in the 2007 United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples [UNDRIP]  (UN 2007).', 'UNDRIP reaffirms Indigenous Peoples’ rights to self-determination as political entities and hon- ors the principle of Indigenous control over Indigenous data (Tsosie 2019; Davis 2016).', 'The rights articulated  in UNDRIP (especially Article 31) also reflect discourse around Indigenous Cultural and Intellectual Property  Rights (ICIP) and Indigenous research ethics (Mātaatua Declaration 1993; Julayinbul Statement 1993; Janke  1998, 2004; Drugge 2016; Tsosie 1997,

Rodriguez-Lonebear  &  Martinez  2019;  Rainie  et  al.', 'MnW  2018;  Nickerson  2017;  TMR  2016).', 'Indigenous  Peoples’  data   comprise (1) information and knowledge about the environment, lands, skies, resources, and non-humans  with which they have relations; (2) information about Indigenous persons such as administrative, census,  health, social, commercial, and corporate and, (3) information and knowledge about Indigenous Peoples  as collectives, including traditional and cultural information, oral histories, ancestral and clan knowledge,  cultural sites, and stories, belongings.', 'The  advancement  of  Indigenous  self-determination  and  the  reclamation  of  Indigenous  identity  and  knowledges over the past 50 years has led to the emergence of Indigenous Data Sovereignty, an assertion  of the rights and interests of Indigenous Peoples in relation to data about them, their territories, and their  ways  of  life  (Carroll,  Rodriguez-Lonebear  &  Martinez  2019;  Rainie  et  al.', 'Kukutai  &  Taylor  2016a;  Snipp  2016).', 'Indigenous  Data  Sovereignty  has  become  an  increasingly  relevant  topic  as  big  data,  open  data, open science, and data reuse become an integral part of research and institutional practices (Carroll,  Rodriguez-Lonebear & Martinez 2019; Lovett et al.', 'Rainie et al.', 'Kukutai & Taylor 2016a; Taylor  & Kukutai 2015).', 'Given that most Indigenous data are held by non-Indigenous governments, institutions,  and agencies, increasing Indigenous Peoples’ participation in data governance activities is central to

governance includes  both  the  stewardship  and  the  processes  necessary  to  implement  Indigenous  control  over  Indigenous  data (collection, storage, analysis, use, reuse) (Carroll, Rodriguez-Lonebear & Martinez 2019; Rainie et al.', 'Walter 2018; Rodriguez-Lonebear 2016; Smith 2016).', 'The development of conceptual frameworks  to  inform  processes  for  stewardship  and  control  of  Indigenous  data  has  been  ongoing  in  areas  such  as   science, research methods, and research governance (Cajete, 2000; Wilson, 2008; Kovach, 2009; McGregor,  Restoule & Johnston, 2018).', 'There is a need to apply insights generated from these frameworks within data  ecosystems to help address the challenge of producing data that reflect Indigenous Peoples’ interests and  governance needs.', 'The Care Principles Rationale  Mainstream values related to research and data are often inconsistent with Indigenous cultures and collec- tive rights.', 'For instance, data historically belonged to the researcher in mainstream settings, a notion that  has shifted under open data and open science movements where publicly funded research requires data  sharing.', 'Meanwhile, Indigenous worldviews have typically centered ‘people’ and ‘purpose’ through govern- ance  processes  that  emphasize  collective  ownership  and  control  of  data  (Carroll,  Rodriguez-Lonebear  &  Martinez 2019; Kukutai & Taylor 2016b; Smith 2016; Snipp 2016).', 'Indigenous Peoples have been working  on ways to authenticate Indigenous forms of knowledge and to fortify their rights to govern research and  resulting data (Garrison et al.', 'Hudson et al.', 'Smith 2012).', 'Drawing on the First Nations principles of OCAP® that created data standards for Ownership, Control,  Access,  and  Possession  in  Canada  in  the  1990s  (FNIGC  2019),  Indigenous  Data  Sovereignty  networks  in  Aotearoa New Zealand, Australia, and the United States, as well as Indigenous scholars, leaders, and allies,  determined that there was an urgent need to develop global principles for the governance of Indigenous  data.', 'Underlying this need were the primary goals of (1) fostering Indigenous self-determination by enhanc- ing Indigenous use of data for Indigenous pursuits and (2) honoring the ‘FAIR Guiding Principles for  scientific  data management and stewardship’ (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) (Wilkinson et al.', 'Indigenous terms.', 'The  ‘CARE  Principles  for  Indigenous  Data  Governance’  (Collective  Benefit,  Authority  to  Control,  Responsibility, and Ethics) (RDA IG 2019) empower Indigenous Peoples by shifting the focus from regulated  consultation  to  value-based  relationships  that  position  data  approaches  within  Indigenous  cultures  and  knowledge systems to the benefit of Indigenous Peoples (Castellano 2004; Anderson et al.', 'This shift  ultimately promotes equitable participation in processes of data reuse, which will result in more equitable  outcomes.', 'Carroll et al: The CARE Principles for Indigenous Data Governance\\x0cArt.', 'Development Academics and practitioners in the International Indigenous Data Sovereignty Interest Group within the  Research Data Alliance (RDA 2017) acknowledged the tension between protecting Indigenous rights and  interests in data and supporting open

adequately covered data-centric principles  and focused their attention on the ‘people’ and ‘purpose’ foci of the Indigenous principles to create the CARE  Principles.', 'Once the four primary CARE Principles of Collective benefit, Authority to control, Responsibility,  and Ethics were identified, participants broke into small groups to outline and draft the language for both  primary  and  sub-principles.', 'The  resulting  draft  was  shared  among  nation-state  based  network  members,  Indigenous leaders, Indigenous scholars, and allies for input (edits, revisions, comments,

that strengthen Indigenous control for improved discovery, access, use, reuse, and  attribution in contemporary data landscapes.', 'Exposition  The CARE Principles address important considerations for modern data ecosystems and across data lifecycles  that support both innovation and Indigenous self-determination (Figure 2).', 'The Principles describe high- level actions applicable within research, government, and institutional data settings.', 'The goal is for data  stewards and other users of Indigenous data to implement CARE and FAIR Principles in tandem.', 'While each is conceptually distinct, the CARE Principles are related to each other.', 'The Principles define  rights,  interests,  and  concepts  to  be  employed  in  facilitating  Indigenous  control  in  data  governance

Full process.', 'Figure 2: The CARE Principles for Indigenous Data Governance.', 'Carroll et al: The CARE Principles for Indigenous Data Governance\\x0cArt.', 'The CARE Principles and Their Supporting Concepts Indigenous data must facilitate collective benefit for Indigenous Peoples to achieve inclusive development  and  innovation,  improve  governance  and  citizen  engagement,  and  realize  equitable  outcomes.', 'Benefits  accrue when data ecosystems are designed and function to support (1) Indigenous nation and community  use and reuse of data; (2) use of data for policy decisions and evaluation of services; and (3) creation and use  of data that reflect community values.', 'UNDRIP affirms Indigenous Peoples’ rights and interests in their data.', 'Recognition of these rights bolsters  Indigenous Peoples’ authority to control and govern such data, further affirming the need for ‘data for  governance.’ Indigenous Peoples must have access to data that support Indigenous governance and self- determination.', 'Indigenous Peoples must be the ones to determine data governance protocols, while being  actively involved in stewardship decisions for Indigenous data that are held by other entities.', 'When working with Indigenous data, there is a responsibility to nurture respectful relationships with  Indigenous Peoples from whom the data originate.', 'Aspects of the relationship include investing in capacity  development, increasing community data capabilities, and embedding data within Indigenous languages  and cultures.', 'Pursuing these goals fulfills the ultimate responsibility of supporting Indigenous data that  advances Indigenous Peoples’ self-determination and collective benefit.', 'Indigenous  Peoples’  rights  and  wellbeing  should  be  the  focus  across  data  ecosystems  and  throughout  data  lifecycles  in  order  to  minimize  harm,  maximize  benefits,  promote  justice,  and  allow  for  future  use.', 'Paramount to ethics in data practices is representation and participation of Indigenous Peoples, who must  be the ones to assess benefits, harms, and potential future uses based on community values and ethics.', 'The CARE Principles in Action The usefulness of high-level Indigenous data governance principles relies on both Indigenous communities  and research/data communities to understand operative concepts and to apply them preemptively across  data  ecosystems  and  lifecycles.', 'Creating  opportunities  for  non-Indigenous  understanding  and  for  Indig- enous leadership in data processes will contribute to the development of data and data systems that can lead  to Indigenous innovation and development.', 'Early Adopters of the CARE Principles  Defining principles is an important step toward exercising Indigenous Data Sovereignty and addressing long- standing concerns about data governance.', 'Some organizations are adopting the CARE Principles through  relationships,  policies,  and  mechanisms.', 'Examples  include  the  Research  Data  Alliance,  the  Smithsonian  Institution, and the Open Data Charter.', 'Research Data Alliance (www.rd-alliance.org), in research environments In 2016, the Research Data Alliance (RDA) hosted a workshop on Indigenous Data Sovereignty.', 'Recogniz- ing  the  importance  of  enhancing  Indigenous  rights  and  interests  in  data  and  potential  implications  for  mainstream data policy, the RDA supported the creation of the International Indigenous Data Sovereignty  Interest Group (IG).', 'The IG convenes existing Indigenous Data Sovereignty networks with other Indigenous  and allied researchers, which has resulted in broader global connections, a deeper focus on research data,  and the CARE Principles (Lovett et al.', 'Rainie et al.', 'RDA IG 2019; RDA 2017).', 'In further support of  the IG and the CARE Principles, the RDA formally affiliated with the Global Indigenous Data Alliance (GIDA),  which hosts the Principles.', 'The affiliation affirms the importance of both CARE and GIDA, and represents an  effort to promote implementation of the Principles throughout the RDA community (RDA 2019).', 'The Smithsonian Institution (www.si.edu), in collections environments In  2012,  the  American  Museum  of  Natural  History  at  the  Smithsonian  Institution  in  Washington,  DC  released  an  Access  and  Benefit  Sharing  Policy  on  Genetic  Resources  in  response  to  the  Nagoya  Protocol  (2010) addressing Indigenous expectations around benefit sharing, prior informed consent, and mutually  agreed terms for collections that it stewards (UN 2011; SI 2012).', 'Subsequently, the US government released  the new Open Access to Research Policy in 2013 as an important step in providing unprecedented access to  research and data (Stebbins 2013).', 'However, this policy (and others like it) treats all data in the same way:  without attention to the nature, the content, or the conditions under which the data was created in the first  place (Creative Commons 2019, Wikimedia 2019).', 'In December 2019, Smithsonian Directive 609 was released (SI 2019).', 'With specific focus on digital asset  access and use, it sets forth Smithsonian policy for access and use of Smithsonian digital assets ahead of the ', 'Carroll et al: The CARE Principles for Indigenous Data Governance\\x0cArt.', 'Open Access Statement, in February 2020.', 'The SD 609 is important,  because it helps identify specific categories of material that might need more attention and care in their  management.', 'One of these includes sensitive content, which is: ', 'Such materials may: a) be considered the private domain of specific individuals, clans,  cults or societies; b) require an appropriate level of knowledge to view and understand; c) threaten  the privacy and well-being of a community when exposed or disclosed to outsiders; and/or d) give  offense  if  inappropriately  used  or  displayed,  or  when  appropriated  or  exploited  for  commercial  purposes.', 'SD 609 Restriction Code: .', 'SI 2019)', 'This identification offers an important opportunity to further explore the incorporation of the CARE Prin- ciples into the Smithsonian’s imminent Open Access policy.', 'Recognizing complexity within Smithsonian  digital assets and accompanying metadata, the CARE Principles would add an important layer of relational  and temporal governance for Indigenous collections within an open access logic.', 'Additionally, there are  further opportunities for the CARE Principles to be directly extended into collection management practices.', 'For example, work is about to begin to develop a unique set of ‘Collection CARE Notices’ for Indigenous  collections at the Smithsonian and then into other US institutional contexts.', 'Extending the current Cul- tural Institution Notices developed by Local Contexts (LC 2018), these new Notices will reflect inherent  relationships  of  care,  responsibility  and  governance  in  collection  stewardship  within  the  institution.', 'As  they  are  developed,  these  Notices  will  integrate  the  CARE  Principles  directly,  embedding  these  into  the  Smithsonian’s  cataloguing  and  digital  infrastructure  for  Indigenous  collections.', 'By  providing  item-  and  collection-specific information, the Collection CARE Notices will function as a direct mechanism to assist in  management and decision-making consistent with CARE Principles.', 'Open Data Charter (opendatacharter.net), in government environments After release of the CARE Principles, the Open Data Charter (ODC) Implementation Working Group hosted  a conversation on the Principles (Stone and Calderon 2019).', 'Discussion focused on implementation mecha- nisms as well as resonance among ODC, FAIR, and CARE Principles (Figure 3).', 'While ODC Principles reflect  all four FAIR Principles, they directly address only the CARE Principle of ‘Collective benefit.’ The ODC Prin- ciple of ‘Open by default’ does not directly map to the FAIR or CARE Principles.', 'During a review of ODC  Principles in 2018, open data community members hotly debated ‘Open by default,’ showing a broad range  of interpretations ranging from construing ‘Open by default’ as a key tenet of open data to considering the  principle as tough to define and operationalize (Stone and Calderon 2019).', 'The CARE Principles can help  refine  and  specify  what  ‘Open  by  default’  means  by  (1)  ensuring  roles  for  Indigenous  Peoples  and  other ', 'Figure 3: The Overlap Between the CARE and FAIR Principles and the Open Data Charter.', 'Carroll et al: The CARE Principles for Indigenous Data Governance\\x0cArt.', 'While implementation has commenced in these examples and elsewhere, further research is needed (1) to  identify mechanisms that support implementation of the CARE Principles; (2) to create tools, policies, and  practices that enact the Principles; (3) to explore the application of the Principles in different contexts, such  as research repositories, knowledge co-production, institutional policies and practices, and, retrospectively,  in already existing databases and systems; and (4) to operationalize the Principles in tandem with the FAIR  Principles.', 'Conclusion Being CARE Full is a prerequisite for equitable data and data practices.', 'The CARE Principles draw from, inte- grate, and build on the work of mainstream stakeholders focused on data for reuse (e.g., FAIR Principles) and  the efforts of Indigenous-led networks and coalitions focused on Indigenous data governance and research  control.', 'While centering data in the FAIR Principles complements other efforts to inform responsibilities  for data producers and repositories, the CARE Principles extend that work to actions that align with the  ‘people’ and ‘purpose’ for which data exist and are used.', 'As the mainstream community of data stakeholders  advances standards and practices to facilitate data reuse and research reproducibility, the CARE Principles  enhance that work by reversing historical power imbalances.', 'The CARE Principles address historical inequi- ties by creating value from Indigenous data in ways that are grounded in Indigenous worldviews and by  realizing opportunities for Indigenous Peoples within the knowledge economy.', 'In addition, increasingly robust management and stewardship frameworks for Indigenous digital resources  to the benefit of Indigenous Peoples have broader implications for other marginalized populations, high- lighting the importance of local and group control for the quality and reproducibility of research and data  (Rainie et al.', 'Furthermore, the CARE Principles address issues of relevance for many populations (e.g.,  privacy, future use, reuse, stewardship), to the extent that the Principles provide a normative foundation for  setting standards, crafting policy, and developing research agendas in relation to data acquired about popu- lations as collectives.', 'Those populations might be minority groups, distinctive communities, or other collec- tives wanting to maintain high levels of trust and accountability in the use of data about their communities.', 'The implementation of the CARE Principles in tandem with the FAIR Principles will result in data that  reflect the realities of Indigenous Peoples, be useful for Indigenous purposes, and remain under Indigenous  control, while promoting knowledge discovery and innovation.', 'The CARE Principles are a guide for data pro- ducers, stewards, and publishers to affirm Indigenous rights to self-determination through CARE Full data  practices that will ultimately address complex issues related to privacy, future use, and collective interests,  and increase the value of data for reuse.', 'Just as the FAIR Principles are a precursor to good data management  and stewardship practices, the CARE Principles encourage data users to be FAIR and CARE.', 'Acknowledgements The  original  workshop  “Indigenous  Data  Sovereignty  Principles  for  the  Governance  of  Indigenous  Data,”  was organized by Stephanie Russo

governance is IT governance, defined as  \"the  leadership  and  organizational  structures  and  processes  that ensure that the organization\\'s IT sustains and extends the  organization\\'s strategies and objectives\" [2].', 'Like corporate  governance, IT governance is also a mature  discipline.', 'Industry bodies, such as the IT Governance Institute  and International Organization for Standardization (ISO), have  established  detailed  IT  governance  standards  and  processes,  which  many  companies  and  government  organizations  have  put into practice.', 'However,  many  of  these  IT  governance  practices  have  evolved  in  a  pattern  based  on  common  IT  organizational  structures  and  deployment  architectures,  which  traditionally  have centered around software

they serve a particular  application, rather than how they serve the strategic interests of  the overall organization.', \"As a result, IT governance practices are designed primarily  around  an  organization's  applications  –  not  its  data.\", 'In  most  organizations, there are clearly defined owners, processes, and  policies  in  place  to  manage  enterprise  software  applications.', 'For example, when a company implements a complex and far- reaching  ERP  system  like  SAP,  the  SAP  implementation  is  typically  managed  and  governed  by  an  SAP  program  office  which has clearly delineated responsibilities for managing and  developing the SAP environment, both from a business and an  IT  perspective  [4].', 'However,  many  organizations  lack  an  equivalent  governance  structure  for  their  most  valuable  core  data assets, such as customer, employee, or product data.', 'World Academy of Science, Engineering and Technology 62 2010939

applications  and  business  processes,  rather  than  being  tied  to  one  specific  application.', 'Therefore,  to  get  the  most  value  out  of  their  enterprise  data,  organizations  need  to

how  data  governance  is  evolving  as  a  practice  today,  its  roots  should  be  reviewed  in  the  broader  context  of  corporate  and  technology  (IT)  governance.', 'A.', 'Corporate and IT Governance  An  established  discipline  for  many  years,  corporate  governance  is  defined  as  \"the  set  of  processes,  customs,  policies, laws, and institutions affecting the way a corporation  is directed, administered or controlled\" [1].', 'One of the practice  areas under corporate governance is IT governance, defined as  \"the  leadership  and  organizational  structures  and  processes  that ensure that the organization\\'s IT sustains and extends the  organization\\'s strategies and objectives\" [2].', 'Like corporate  governance, IT governance is also a mature  discipline.', 'Industry bodies, such as the IT Governance Institute  and International Organization for Standardization (ISO), have  established  detailed  IT  governance  standards  and  processes,  which  many  companies  and  government  organizations  have  put into practice.', 'However,  many  of  these  IT  governance  practices  have  evolved  in  a  pattern  based  on  common  IT  organizational  structures  and  deployment  architectures,  which  traditionally  have centered around software applications such as enterprise  resource planning (ERP) or customer relationship management  (CRM).', 'From  mainframes  to  client-server  architectures  to  Web  applications,  IT  departments  have  focused  on  the  applications  and  the  user  interfaces  to  those  applications,  rather than on  data that drives the applications [3].', 'Typically,  data are managed in the context of how they serve a particular  application, rather than how they serve the strategic interests of  the overall organization.', \"As a result, IT governance practices are designed primarily  around  an  organization's  applications  –  not  its  data.\", 'In  most  organizations, there are clearly defined owners, processes, and  policies  in  place  to  manage  enterprise  software  applications.', 'For example, when a company implements a complex and far- reaching  ERP  system  like  SAP,  the  SAP  implementation  is  typically  managed  and  governed  by  an  SAP  program  office  which has clearly delineated responsibilities for managing and  developing the SAP environment, both from a business and an  IT  perspective  [4].', 'However,  many  organizations  lack  an  equivalent  governance  structure  for  their  most  valuable  core  data

operational challenges that demand high-quality corporate data.', 'Hitherto, companies  have assigned accountabilities for DQM mostly to IT departments.', 'They have thereby ignored the organisational  issues that are critical to the success of DQM.', 'With data governance, however, companies implement corporate- wide accountabilities for DQM that encompass professionals from business and IT.', 'This paper outlines a data  governance model comprised of three components.', 'Data quality roles, decision areas and responsibilities build a  matrix, comparable to a RACI chart.', 'The data governance model documents the data quality roles and their type  of  interaction  with  DQM  activities.', 'Companies  can  structure  their  company-specific  data  governance  model  based on these

models.', 'Global  presence  requires  harmonised  business processes across different continents, customers ask for individualised products, and service offerings  must be industrialised (cf.', 'Borzo 2005).', 'These factors certainly impact the business process architecture and the  IT  strategy  of  organisations.', 'Ultimately,  however,  data  of  high  quality  are  a  prerequisite  for  fulfilling  these  changing  business  requirements  and  for  achieving  enterprise  agility  objectives  (Newman  &  Logan  2006b).', 'In  addition to such strategic factors, some operational domains directly rely on high-quality corporate data, such as  business networking (Vermeer 2000; Madnick et al.', 'Tellkamp et al.', 'Zahay  &  Griffin  2003;  Reid  &  Catterall  2005;  Crié  &  Micheaux  2006),  decision-making  and  business  intelligence  (Shankaranarayan, Ziad & Wang 2003; Price & Shanks 2005), and regulatory compliance (Friedman 2006).', 'Data quality management (DQM) focuses on the collection, organisation, storage, processing, and presentation  of  high-quality  data.', 'In  addition,  there  are  organisational  issues  that  must  be  addressed,  such  as  maintaining  sponsorship,  managing  expectation,  avoiding  scope  creep,  and  handling  political  issues  (Wang  et  al.', 'English  1999;  Nohr  2001;  Eppler  2006).', 'However,  responsibility  for  improving  data  quality  and  managing  corporate data is often assigned to IT departments (Friedman 2006).', 'Also, many companies try to cope with data  quality  (DQ)  issues  by  simply  implementing  data  management  or  data  warehouse  systems.', 'Surveys  on  data  warehousing  failures  reveal  that  organisational  rather  than  technical  issues  are  more  critical  to  their  success  (Watson, Fuller & Ariyachandra 2004).', 'Integrated  DQM  is  required  in  order  to  address  both  organisational  and  IT  perspectives.', 'Successful  DQ  programs  identify the organisational processes behind DQ (Bitterer & Newman 2007).', 'With data governance,  companies  implement  corporate-wide  accountabilities  for  DQM  that  encompass  professionals  from  both  business and IT.', 'Data governance defines roles and assigns accountabilities for decision areas and activities to  these  roles.', 'It  establishes  organisation-wide  guidelines  and  standards  for  DQM  and  assures  compliance  with  corporate strategy and laws governing data.', 'There  is  only  limited  research  on  data  governance.', 'Apart  from  a  few  DQM  approaches  dealing  with  accountabilities  (Redman  1996;  English  1999),  an  elaborate  analysis  of  the  interaction  of  roles  and  responsibilities,  and  the  design  of  decision-making  structures  is  missing.', 'For  our  research,  we  therefore  incorporate data governance sources from consultants, analysts and practitioners (e.g., Swanton 2005; Dember  2006a;  Dyché  &  Levy  2006a;  Marco  &

'Both  academic  and  practical  sources  presume  data  governance  as  a  universal  approach  –  one  that  fits  all  enterprises  alike.', 'Research  on  IT  governance  indicates  that  the  distribution  of  accountabilities  for  IT  management  differs  between  companies  and  that  several  IT  governance  models  exist,  such  as  centralised  and  decentralised IT governance (Brown, C.V. 1997; Sambamurthy & Zmud 1999; Weill 2004).', 'Previous research  falls  short  of  providing  a  comparable  analysis  for  data  governance  and  the  accountabilities  for  DQM.', 'We  suggest that – similar to IT governance – a data governance configuration is specific to a given company.', 'Our  main  contribution  is  to  propose  a  flexible  data  governance  model  composed  of  roles,  decision  areas  and  responsibilities, which documents and illustrates the company-specific data governance configuration.', 'Whereas  we focus on this accountability aspect of data governance in this paper, we do not examine its guidelines and  compliance facet.', 'We contribute to DQM research by advancing the state of the art regarding data governance.', 'In contrast to prior  research, we propose a model to document the company-specific decision-making framework of DQM.', 'The data  governance  model  outlines  the  three  components  of  such  a  framework,  namely  roles,  decision  areas  and  responsibilities.', 'For  the  components,  we  identify  typical  data  quality  roles  and  decision  areas,  and  propose  a  method  to  assign  responsibilities.', 'Our  approach  respects  the  fact  that  each  company  needs  a  specific  data  governance  configuration.', 'A  data  governance  model  helps  companies  to  structure  and  document  their  DQ  accountabilities.', 'The  remainder  of  the  paper  is  structured  as  follows:  The  following  section  introduces  related  work  on  data  quality  management  and  data  governance.', 'The  next  section  outlines  the  idea  and  the  structure  of  the  data  governance model.', 'It proposes a set of data quality roles, decision areas, and responsibilities.', 'The last section  summarises this paper and discusses its contribution.', 'Data Quality Management and Data Governance ', 'We refer to data quality management as quality-oriented data management, i.e., data management focusing on  collecting, organising, storing, processing, and presenting high-quality dat.', 'The organisational issues that must  be addressed, such as maintaining sponsorship, managing expectation and compliance, defining accountabilities,  avoiding scope creep, and handling political issues, push DQM into an area of conflict between business and IT.', 'On  the  one  hand,  DQM  has  to  provide  many  stakeholders  (e.g.,  CxOs,  sales,  controlling,  procurement,  IT,  business  units,  customers,  public  authorities)  with  high-quality  corporate  data.', 'On  the  other  hand,  these  stakeholders  have  different  interests  (e.g.,  local/regional/company-wide  differences),  which  do  not  necessarily  accumulate to the best achievable result for the company as a whole.', 'Because of these particularities of DQM,  large  multi-business  companies  are  likely  to  have  difficulties  with  institutionalising  DQM,  i.e.,  defining  accountabilities, assigning people accountable for DQM within the organisational structure, and enforcing DQM  mandates throughout the company.', 'Data  governance  –  as  part  of  DQM  –  addresses  these  particular  issues  within  corporate  structures.', 'Data  governance specifies the framework for decision rights and accountabilities to encourage desirable behaviour in  the use of dat.', 'Academic research on data governance is still in its infancy.', 'DQM approaches, such as Total  Data Quality Management (TDQM) (Wang 1998; Wang et al.', 'Huang, Lee & Wang 1999), mainly address  DQM  activities  and  decision  areas.', 'The  only  role  accountable  in  TDQM  is  the  information  product  manager,  which  ensures  that  relevant,  high-quality  information  products  are  delivered  to  information  consumers.', 'Few  DQM  approaches  (Redman  1996;  English  1999)  deal  with  more  than  one  role,  roles  related  to  several  organisational  levels,  and  their  tasks  and  responsibilities.', 'Due  to  the  limited  research  on  data  governance,  we  also  analysed  data  governance  sources  from  consultants,  analysts  and  practitioners  (Swanton  2005;  Dember  2006a;  Dyché  &  Levy  2006a;  Marco  &  Smith  2006;  Newman  &  Logan  2006a;  Russom  2006;  Bitterer  &  Newman  2007).', 'However,  all  available  sources  postulate  a  universal  data  governance  approach  –  one  that  should  fit  all  companies  alike.', 'An  elaborate  analysis  of  the  interaction  of  roles  and  responsibilities,  and  the  design of decision-making structures is missing.', 'Hence, companies might find it difficult to establish and maintain organisational structures designed to assure  and  sustain  high-quality  data  throughout  the  enterprise.', 'Findings  of  a  recent  survey  among  data  management  professionals  indicate  that  data  governance  is  rarely  adopted  (Russom  2006).', 'Only  8%  of  respondents  had  deployed a data governance initiative, 17% were in the design or implementation phase.', 'The term data is often distinguished from information by referring to data as “raw” or simple facts and to information as  data put in a context or data that has been processed (Huang, Lee & Wang 1999; Price & Shanks 2005).', 'In line with most  data or information quality publications, we use the terms data and information interchangeably throughout the paper.', 'In the absence of academic definitions of data governance, this definition was adapted from the IT governance definition of  (Weill 2004).', 'Australasian Conference on Information Systems  5-7 Dec 2007, Toowoomba ', 'A Model for Data Governance  Wende ', 'Research  into  IT  governance  is  more  advanced  than  research  into  data  governance,  with the first publications  released  25  years  ago  (cf.', 'Brown,  C.V.  1997).', 'IT  governance  follows  a  more  flexible  approach  for  the  assignment  of  accountabilities.', 'Early  research  distinguished  two  IT  governance  models:  in  centralised  models  corporate IT performs all IT functions, whereas in decentralised models business units’ IT performs these tasks  (e.g.,  Ein-Dor  &  Segev  1982).', 'Subsequent  research  specified  more  precise  IT  governance  models,  acknowledging several IT functions (e.g., Sambamurthy & Zmud 1999) and more than one organisational level  involved (Brown, C.V. 1997).', 'Finally, Weill (2004) proposed five IT functions, three organisational units, and a  distinction between decision and input rights.', 'The combination of these three dimensions resulted in six feasible  IT governance models.', 'In  conclusion,  IT  governance  research  proposes  three  elements  that  compose  an  IT  governance  model:  roles,  major decisions areas and assignment of accountabilities.', 'We assume that such flexible models – instead of the  universal  data  governance  approaches  postulated  by  prior  research  –  would  help  companies  to  structure  and  document their specific decision-making framework for DQM.', 'Therefore, we adopt the idea of IT governance  models to build a model for data governance.', 'However, it is important to emphasise that data governance is not a full subset of IT governance.', 'As outlined  above,  accomplishing corporate data quality requires close collaboration among IT and business professionals  who understand the data and its business purpose.', 'Hence, we argue that data governance and IT governance are  coequal  and  both  have  to  follow  corporate  governance  principles.', 'Furthermore,  data  governance  should  be  clearly  distinguished  from  DQM  (Dyché  &  Levy  2006a;  Russom  2006;  Bitterer  &  Newman  2007):  data  governance  provides  a  framework  for  management  decisions;  actual  “day-to-day”  decision-making  is  DQM.', 'Figure 1 illustrates the relationships between the terms explained.', 'Corporate Governance', 'Governance', 'Management', 'Data Quality  Strategy',

this demonstrates how the abstract models can easily overlap in practice.', 'PDTs represent a form of public-driven governance that could signiﬁcantly redistribute the value of data and increase fairness, but requires the support of a new legal framework mandating access to data for public interest.', 'Similarly, DCs are a fairer alternative of surveillance capitalism, but struggle to ﬁnd ﬁnancial sustainability and to reach a critical mass of users.', 'Therefore we did not ﬁnd a single model to be ‘recom- mended’ or ‘promoted’ for a fairer data landscape.', 'Instead, a combination of all these models should be envisioned for a ‘desirable future’ (Jasanoff, 2015).', 'In particular, to oppose the privatisation of internet gov- ernance (DeNardis, 2019), and the resulting dominant model of data governance stirred by big tech platforms, it is advisable to look at the inventive data practices of civic society and public bodies as it is from these actors that we have found more interest in the redistribution of value generated through data.', 'An important dimension to discuss is the extent to which these models democratise data governance.', 'To answer this question we turn our attention to three models that involve data subjects.', 'In all cases, data subjects can choose a trusted intermediary for their data, being it a commercial service from an ecosystem of personal data spaces, a cooperative that allow to keep democratic control over data and share responsi- bilities (DCs), or a public body that is entrusted by citizens to use (their) data ethically and for the public interest (PDTs).', 'Involving subjects in the governance of data is a key strategy to address, and avoid, many of the possible negative consequences of data governance, such as dataveillance, function creep, technocratic gov- ernance, etc.', 'Kitchin, 2014).', 'The more powerful data subjects are in a data governance model, the greater accountability is required to the data holders, which in turn limits risks and data misuses.', 'At the opposite end, DSPs are only accessible to data holders.', 'How does that model guarantee that needs and interests of data subjects large and marginalised groups) are accounted for?', 'To address this, and for good data governance, it may be advisable to combine DSPs with the others models that offer more guaran- tees, at least in principle, in terms of accountability.', 'The ﬁndings of this article highlight that the same ‘buzzword’ can be associated to different rationalities of data governance, the notion of data since intermediaries and data trusts is included somehow in all models.', 'This underlines how important it is to think critically about data infrastructures as socio-technical products, moving beyond mere instrumental and tech- nical aspects.', 'Data trusts might be powerful means to reduce the power unbalances of the current data econ- omy if adopted within DCs, while they may foster very different aims in DSPs. Indeed, in the ﬁrst case these would be ‘bottom-up data trusts’ that act in behalf of citizens’ (Delacroix and Lawrence, 2019), while the latter would be repeatable frameworks of terms and mechanism to facilitate the sharing of data (Hall and Pesenti, 2017).', 'Conversely, data trusts could also be a service offered by the public sector in a top-down manner to earn trust and foster the public interest, as in PDTs.', 'A ﬁnal consideration concerns the intertwined rela- tionship between the data practices we have examined and the regulatory frameworks in which they exist.', 'These data governance models can only develop fur- ther if they are sustained by appropriate legal frame- works, such as the GDPR for personal data or a new legal act to mandate access to commercial data of public interest.', 'With the recent developments in data policy (EC, 2020a), the EC is strengthening its role as transnational regulator of technology with repercus- sions on a global scale.', 'In doing so, it will be crucial', 'Big Data & Society', 'Limitations', 'The lack of established terms in the ﬁeld, as well as the ever-changing nature of the theme, has complicated the selection of documents.', 'The procedure adopted for retrieving resources, detailed in the methodology sec- tion, is not entirely systematic, hence the ﬁndings have to be contextualised in that approach, including the time span in which the research has been conducted and the European focus.', 'Furthermore, the described models do not claim to represent the full spectrum of emerging models currently developed for the gover- nance of data.', 'Being ideal types, they have a heuristic value as tools to be adopted for further studies.', 'Another limitation relates to our multi-dimensional framework that derives from our research questions.', 'In focusing exclusively on the dimensions of stakeholders, governance goals, value from the data, governance mechanisms, and reciprocity, we acknowledge that many more lenses could have been adopted, such as, for example, the perspectives of trust and distrust, pri- vacy and data protection, authority and authorities, law and regulations.', 'We selected the dimensions we thought were the most appropriate to examine emerg- ing data practices from a social science perspective, yet we acknowledge other important elements might have been included.', 'A ﬁnal limitation is that we do not include primary data collected to investigate what lays behind the fac¸ade of practitioners’ literature.', 'We are indeed addressing this aspect through empirical research as a means to examine the characteristics of some of these models and the challenges for their implementation, largely in an urban context.', 'This study in fact aims to lay the foundation for future investigations of how socio-technical assemblages unfold around different manifestations of data governance.', 'How far these models work in practice?', 'To what extent are these rep- licable in different contexts?', 'What are the key enablers and obstacles?', 'This type of microanalysis could help recognise which mechanisms are used (or lacking) in each particular context and which strategic practices are essential.', 'Conclusions', 'Notwithstanding its limitations, this study shows that academia, from public many', 'We discussed four of the models that emerge from the practices of these actors.', 'The social practices for data access, sharing, control and use, and the derived models come at a cru- cial time as the discussion on data governance and data sovereignty is building a new momentum in Europe with the emergence of AI as a strategic area of policy for the future of society.', 'Therefore, we believe it is (and will be) to examine data governance arrangements in a rapid and timely manner (Mann et al., 2019), and understand how to incentivise uses of data at the service of the public good.', 'To do so, it might be helpful to adopt also a social science perspec- tive on data governance that allows seeing ‘through the infrastructure’ to ask: what principles guide data shar- ing and use?', 'What is done with data and who can access and participate in its governance?', 'What value is produced and how it is redistributed?', 'Ultimately, this article wishes to encourage more ‘normative con- versations’ on socio-technical imaginaries

and it is expected to foster a socially bene- ﬁcial usage of data through the development of new data-driven services centred on user needs (Ilves and Osimo, 2019; Lehtiniemi, 2017).', 'Among the main mechanisms enabling PDS are per- sonal data spaces, like Digi.me, Citizen-me or Meeco, which consist of ‘intermediary services’ allowing users to store their personal data, collecting data disseminat- ed in different platforms, and control their sharing with third parties (Lehtiniemi, 2017).', 'These services, which appeared in early 2000s, have been strengthened by Art.', 'GDPR (data portability).', 'They are expected to remove obstacles for individuals wanting to exchange their data for research or other purposes, acting as trusted intermediaries and improving citizens’ ability to make choices about their data (Delacroix and Lawrence, 2019).', 'PDS has been especially encouraged within the con- text of MyData, an international movement and a community of activists, non-proﬁt organisations, think-tanks as well as commercial actors, start-ups and SMEs.

they are not included in the relation and are at best depicted as recipients of the innovations developed through it.', 'PDS on the contrary place data subjects at the centre of an ecosystem of new services that provide them the means to access, control, share and analyse their data.', 'Based on the principle of sovereignty, this model emphasises individual control over data and self- determination, and it is in strike contrast to surveil- lance capitalism (Lehtiniemi, 2017).', 'A movement of data activists is promoting this progressive goal, at the same time commercial actors are interested in it', 'In PDS different kinds of actors, with different inter- ests, converge for the promotion of a ‘fairer data econ- omy’ (Ilves and Osimo, 2019).', 'This tension leads to some inconsistencies.', 'A fully private ecosystem of intermediary services, even if allowing users to control their data, would leave the incumbency of addressing the power asymmetries of the current data landscape to the market (Lehtiniemi and Haapoja, 2020).', 'From studies on citizens’ perspectives on their digital data, it also appears that the majority would not have the skills and interest to take advantage of the opportuni- ties offered by these (e.g. Andrejevic, 2014).', 'A wider range of actors is involved in PDTs, with public bodies taking the lead.', 'The underlying principle of PDTs is that all data with a public interest compo- nent is part of a nation infrastructure, and therefore the information it affords should be ‘socialised’ to produce value for citizens and society as a whole.', 'Actors from public sector, non-proﬁt, business and academia take part in PDTs. Data subjects, however, are not just recipients of the services developed through data.', 'To be effective, PDTs imply the establishment of a rela- tionship of trust with citizens who must be reassured their personal information is protected and that will be used for the public interest.', 'To achieve this objective, public bodies need to build trust listening to requests from civic society.', 'As recent failed initiatives (Sidewalk Toronto), as well as the debate for COVID-19 contact tracing apps (Ada Lovelace Institute, 2020), show this is something that public bodies are (still) learning to do.', 'Another challenge for PDTs is to establish data sharing agreements with private companies, which might have data of public interest but not be willing to share it unless regulations mandate it.', 'DCs are a grassroots-driven decentralised data gov- ernance model in which citizens voluntarily pool their data together establishing a relationship of trust with the cooperative that manages data on their behalf.', 'Data subjects preserve democratic control over data and have an equitable share in the beneﬁts produced, which are often aimed at the public interest (such as medical research).', 'Drawing from the principles of the cooperative movement and platform cooperatives, this model is in stark opposition to platform capitalism and aims to be a fairer, transparent and non-monopolistic alternative.', 'Big tech platform might be completely excluded from data governance in a DC – even if infor- mally present as the ‘antagonistic actor’ – or be includ- ed only as a data provider from which users take their data.', 'Although DC raise a lot of interest in the policy debate as an ethical approach to data sharing, they struggle to scale up and reach a critical mass of users (Sandoval, 2020).', 'Micheli et al.', 'With respect to the kind of value pursued, we see that DPS mainly focus on producing economic value, while other forms of value gradually ‘chime in’ in the remaining models, such as social change, public inter- est, fairness, and data subjects’ self-determination.', 'It should also be noted that for the most part, these models could be found in niche initiatives or pilot proj- ects, and there is still limited research concerning the value they generate and their sustainability over time (Borkin, 2019; Verhulst, 2019).', 'Value production and redistribution, thus, can be assessed more at the level of the imaginary, than from evaluations of tangible out- comes.', 'Nevertheless, adopting a normative perspective informed by CDS, we could ask to what extent these data foster a redistribution of value.', 'In DSPs, data is a ‘market commodity’ and econom- ic value is redistributed horizontally among data hold- ers who join the partnership.', 'PDS put forward important innovations for data subjects’ exerting digi- tal rights, but do not question the dataﬁcation and commodiﬁcation mechanisms of the platform society (Van Dijck et al., 2018).', 'They are oriented towards the creation of value for the individual (self-determina- tion) and new commercial actors (data services), with public interest as a by-product of these.', 'The remaining models expressively pursue the public interest: DCs allow data subjects to collect and aggregate their data for the public interest, while PDTs act on behalf of citizens, aggregating and analysing different data sour- ces to inform policy-making and address societal chal- lenges.', 'If in DCs a cooperative has to be trusted, in PDTs is a public body.', 'Yet, in the latter, it might also be that a trusted external independent organisa- tion acts as a data intermediary between citizens and a public body; this demonstrates how the abstract models can easily overlap in practice.', 'PDTs represent a form of public-driven governance that could signiﬁcantly redistribute the value of data and increase fairness, but requires the support of a new legal framework mandating access to data for public interest.', 'Similarly, DCs are a fairer alternative of surveillance capitalism, but struggle to ﬁnd ﬁnancial sustainability and to reach a critical mass of users.', 'Therefore we did not ﬁnd a single model to be ‘recom- mended’ or ‘promoted’ for a fairer data landscape.', 'Instead, a combination of all these models should be envisioned for a ‘desirable future’ (Jasanoff, 2015).', 'In particular, to oppose the privatisation of internet gov- ernance (DeNardis, 2019), and the resulting dominant model of data governance stirred by big tech platforms, it is advisable to look at the inventive data practices of civic society and public bodies as it is from these actors that we have found more interest in the redistribution of value generated through data.', 'An important dimension to discuss is the extent to which these models democratise data governance.', 'To answer this question we turn our attention to three models that involve data subjects.', 'In all cases, data subjects can choose a trusted intermediary for their data, being it a commercial service from an ecosystem of personal data spaces, a cooperative that allow to keep democratic control over data and share responsi- bilities (DCs), or a public body that is entrusted by citizens to use (their) data ethically and for the public interest (PDTs).', 'Involving subjects in the governance of data is a key strategy to address, and avoid, many of the possible negative consequences of data governance, such as dataveillance, function creep, technocratic gov- ernance, etc.', 'Kitchin, 2014).', 'The more powerful data subjects are in a data governance model, the greater accountability is required to the data holders, which in turn limits risks and data misuses.', 'At the opposite end, DSPs are only accessible to data holders.', 'How does that model guarantee that needs and interests of data subjects large and marginalised groups) are accounted for?', 'To address this, and for good data governance, it may be advisable to combine DSPs with the others models that offer more guaran- tees, at least in principle, in terms of accountability.', 'The ﬁndings of this article highlight that the same ‘buzzword’ can be associated to different rationalities of data governance, the notion of data since intermediaries and data trusts is included somehow in all models.', 'This underlines how important it is to think critically about data infrastructures as socio-technical products, moving beyond mere instrumental and tech- nical aspects.', 'Data trusts might be powerful means to reduce the power unbalances of the current data econ- omy if adopted within DCs, while they may foster very different aims in DSPs. Indeed, in the ﬁrst case these would be ‘bottom-up data trusts’ that act in behalf of citizens’ (Delacroix and Lawrence, 2019), while the latter would be repeatable frameworks of terms and mechanism to facilitate the sharing of data (Hall and Pesenti, 2017).', 'Conversely, data trusts could also be a service offered by the public sector in a top-down manner to earn trust and foster the public interest, as in PDTs.', 'A ﬁnal consideration concerns the intertwined rela- tionship between the data practices we have examined and the regulatory frameworks in which they exist.', 'These data governance models can only develop fur- ther if they are sustained by appropriate legal frame- works, such as the GDPR for personal data or a new legal act to mandate access to commercial data of public interest.', 'With the recent developments in data policy (EC, 2020a), the EC is strengthening its role as transnational regulator of technology with repercus- sions on a global scale.', 'In doing so, it will be crucial', 'Big Data & Society', 'Limitations', 'The lack of established terms in the ﬁeld, as well as the ever-changing nature of the theme, has complicated the selection of documents.', 'The procedure adopted for retrieving resources, detailed in the methodology sec- tion, is not entirely systematic, hence the ﬁndings have to be contextualised in that approach, including the time span in which the research has been conducted and the European focus.', 'Furthermore, the described models do not claim to represent the full spectrum of emerging models currently developed for the gover- nance of data.', 'Being ideal types, they have a heuristic value as tools to be adopted for further studies.', 'Another limitation relates to our multi-dimensional framework that derives from our research questions.', 'In focusing exclusively on the dimensions of stakeholders, governance goals, value from the data, governance mechanisms, and reciprocity, we acknowledge that many more lenses could have been adopted, such as, for example, the perspectives of trust and distrust, pri- vacy and data protection, authority and authorities, law and regulations.', 'We selected the dimensions we thought were the most appropriate to examine emerg- ing data practices from a social science perspective, yet we acknowledge other important elements might have been included.', 'A ﬁnal limitation is that we do not include primary data collected to investigate what lays behind the fac¸ade of practitioners’ literature.', 'We are indeed addressing this aspect through empirical research as a means to examine the characteristics of some of these models and the challenges for their implementation, largely in an urban context.', 'This study in fact aims to lay the foundation for future investigations of how socio-technical assemblages unfold around different manifestations of data governance.', 'How far these models work in practice?', 'To what extent are these rep- licable in different contexts?', 'What are the key enablers and obstacles?', 'This type of microanalysis could help recognise which mechanisms are used (or lacking) in each particular context and which strategic practices are essential.', 'Conclusions', 'Notwithstanding its limitations, this study shows that academia, from public many', 'We discussed four of the models that emerge from the practices of these actors.', 'The social practices for data access, sharing, control and use, and the derived models come at a cru- cial time as the discussion on data governance and data sovereignty is building a new momentum in Europe with the emergence of AI as a strategic area of policy for the future of society.', 'Therefore, we believe it is (and will be) to examine data governance arrangements in a rapid and timely manner (Mann et al., 2019), and understand how to incentivise uses of data at the service of the public good.', 'To do so, it might be helpful to adopt also a social science perspec- tive on data governance that allows seeing ‘through the infrastructure’ to ask: what principles guide data shar- ing and use?', 'What is done with data and who can access and participate in its governance?', 'What value is produced and how it is redistributed?', 'Ultimately, this article wishes to encourage more ‘normative con- versations’ on socio-technical imaginaries

statistics from growing numbers of text and speech records to drastically improve the performance and applicability of data-driven Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems.', 'As a result, language technologies have become an integral part of daily lived experience in a greater variety of areas both online (Internet search engines, content recommenda- tion and moderation in social media) and offline (automatic transla- tion and speech transcription in official documents and interactions) to the point of becoming near ubiquitous.', 'Consequently, through being so deeply embedded into modern human life, the governance of these new forms of infrastructure —or the lack thereof —has come to exert power over individuals’ and communities’ lives and access to technology.', 'These practical applications of language technology are increas- ingly reliant on approaches based on trained Large Language Mod- els (LLMs) [23, 41, 104, 111], whereby models are first exposed to as large and varied a collection of language data as possible with the aim of extracting “general” properties of a language of interest.', 'This first step then makes it easier to fine-tune models that learn to perform a range of “specific” NLP tasks more efficiently in that same language setting.', 'As such, the language corpora used to train LLMs need to meet significantly different requirements than the more purpose-specific datasets that have hitherto supported major advances in data-driven NLP.', 'Indeed, while concerns of “generality” are not new to the field of Machine Learning (ML), this two-stage approach of (pre-)training followed by further training and fine- tuning for a task has given them a new scope; where the properties identified by the model are expected to hold across a much greater variety of tasks, domains, and settings as long as they are in the same “language(s)” as the text it was pre-trained on.', 'However, whereas recent advances in modeling and hardware have increased the data training capacity of LLMs, increasing from Wikipedia-scale corpora to close to three orders of magni- tude more, 1 devising methods for carefully identifying, obtaining, and managing a sufficiently large and diverse collection of lan- guage data to take full advantage of this increased capacity has remained an elusive endeavor.', 'Indeed, in order to support such ambitions of generality, this collection would need to include lan- guage data from a great diversity of carefully curated sources to', 'Figure 1: Overview of the Data Stewardship Organization and Actors', 'English (further discussed by Blasi et al.', 'This requires a more intentional approach to collecting and working with data, but designing a data gover- nance structure to appropriately handle such varied data sources while respecting the rights and interests of their stakeholders presents a unique challenge that is only partly met by existing language data management approaches.', 'To better address these needs, we propose a new model for data governance in the form of a Data Stewardship Organization (DSO, see Figure 1 diagram) working in conjunction with related stake- holders and rights holders.', 'The DSO primarily aims to foster the agency of data subjects and rights holders with respect to the uses of their data as the amount and diversity of contexts for this data grows.', 'It is designed to enable multiple stakeholders to collaborate on the decisions that go into building and managing a collection of language resources, so as to meet goals of responsible data gover- nance at a scale and diversity that may support this new generation of data-driven language technology.', 'While our work is grounded by the goal of training a multilingual LLM, we also note that many of the constraints and impacts of the design choices proposed in this work hold across a greater variety of uses of human-centric research and development data.', 'We endeavor to also consider these related applications when relevant.', 'Research Context and Paper Outline The research presented in this paper is conducted in the context of a year-long, distributed, collaborative

processes by defining both its object, namely human-centric data used in NLP (2.3), and its relationship to other aspects of data management (2.4).', 'Approaching Collaborative Governance:', 'Theories and Mechanisms', 'Governance is a nebulous concept, defined by the Commission on Global Governance [32] as “the sum of the many ways individuals and institutions, public and private, manage their common affairs”.', 'Topics such as technology governance have received increasing at- tention in the last few decades as the digital transformation of the late 20th and early 21st century has increased the speed at which technological innovation changes people’s lives around the world [139], leading to extensive analyses of the processes, dynam- ics, and particular challenges of global governance.', 'One such challenge has proven to be the impossibility of gov- erning any individual subject in isolation in a fully integrated world, a phenomenon studied under the name of regime com- plexes [99].', 'Keohane and Victor [77] study the case of the regime complex for climate change, whose global governance happens at the intersection of e.g., UN and local legal regimes and bilateral agreements and spans topics such as trade regulation, technology, or geoengineering.', 'Consequently, governance efforts need to ac- count for fragmentation when organizations in inter-connected areas make choices that have bearing on each other; by examin- ing these connections and positioning any decision within a dense network of issues and entities [143].', 'Data governance, especially of language data, is similarly integrated in a multitude of related areas, of which Section 3 will discuss the social, legal, and technical dimensions.', 'Having a broad classification of the mechanisms that underpin governance can help us better navigate this network.', 'In addition to the laws & regulations in their various regimes, previous work has focused on the specific role of tools &

Triad', 'In general, we can map mechanisms reviewed in governance literature to one or to the intersection of two of these pillars (Figure 2).', 'For example, Ada Lovelace Institute et al.', 'A similar analysis may be applied to works studying governance’s aim to identify and resolve ten- sions between actors.', 'Emerson et al.', 'The approach of Feiock [52] addresses dilemmas stemming from

shift or entrench power im- balances, and advised to pay special attention to this phenomenon.', 'Barnett and Duvall [10] and Purdy [108] examine how authority, resources, and discursive legitimacy can lead to exclusion within collaborative governance efforts.', 'In particular, Mohamed et al.', 'AI governance: values that protect and are of interest to the people who write the standards will

that led to the initial set of values in more details.', 'Among these values, the stated goal of inclusivity merits fur- ther examination.', 'Our project aims to govern global language data, which as we shall see in Section 3.1 shows significant variation across cultural and social contexts.', 'Meanwhile, the participants of our research project remain embodied in their own subjectivi- ties [68], which necessarily represent but a small portion of these contexts.', 'As such, devising a governance structure based solely on values expressed by our participants runs the risk of prioritizing their interests and excluding visions that may be more relevant to other language users [65].', 'Additionally grounding the definition of our proposed values in Human Rights frameworks constitutes an appealing starting point to addressing these limitations given their global reach, varied realizations (both historically and geo- graphically), and general recognition as an accepted foundation of good governance [55].', 'Indeed, we find that documents such as the UDHR [8], ICCPR [6], or ICESCR [7] echo the proposed values of non-discrimination, privacy and just rewards respectively, and help ground them in an external system [106].', 'At the same time, while the principle of Human Rights does have a universal scope, the staggering number and diversity of human rights documents written both at the UN 6 and regional level brings to light the inadequacy of focusing on a limited set of human rights document as absolute grounding when outlining values that apply equitably to a global and contemporary setting, as it arises from significant differences in their philosophical foundations across the globe [122].', 'Scholarship at the intersection of decoloniality and human rights in particular has called out the need to question the universality of how we conceptualize the “human” in Human Rights [51, 89].', 'Furthermore, the focus of human rights discourse has historically been on the relationship between the individual and the state [117], whereas the language data we propose to govern is', 'Data Governance in the Age of Large-Scale Data-Driven Language Technology', 'FAccT ’22, June 21–24, 2022, Seoul, Republic of Korea', 'Thus, acknowledging both the need for respecting local expertise and conceptualization of human rights [5] and for more relational and community-oriented notions of justice [17, 98], we complement our initial set of values as outlined in Table 1 to explicitly include the pri- oritization of local knowledge when realizing shared aspirations in the context of participants’ own expression of values, and con- versely participation in shaping these over-arching governance values to better account for their specific needs.', 'Object of Governance: Distributed', 'Language Data', 'We apply the norms and values described above to a governance structure for language data, paying special attention to its use in ML datasets.', 'In the ML world, data refers to any digital representation of acts, facts or other information in forms that include text, images, video, or audio recordings [2, 100, 134], which may be collated or formed into more complex information [13].', 'It is often described via analogy as food and fuel for ML systems, water and oil as an AI resource, and increasingly as records of human activity [128].', 'As such, it is a fundamental catalyst for the creation of artificial intelli- gence systems [13], used for training, developing and/or testing AI systems in the form of datasets, an organized collection of data for a defined task [100].', 'The proposed data governance structure introduced in this paper focuses on digital language data, which includes text from news and academic articles, reports, white papers, blogs, social media posts, radio shows, and digitized books.', 'All such data is created by a person, group of people, or an organization who may hold the rights to that data.', 'All of these dimensions of the language data and datasets it’s organized as have bearing on the governance choices (see Table 2 for examples of categories).', 'Of particular sensitivity in data governance is human-centric data, data that additionally refers to or represents the ideas of a person.', 'Some kinds of textual data such as weather reports are less likely to harm an individual in case of lax governance or misuse, but human-centric data brings with it concerns around how an individual is represented, how that representation may affect them, the represented individual’s consent, and other fundamental and legal rights [1].', 'The specific risks to be considered depend on the individual’s relationship to the data, from creators who may have commercial rights on the product of their work to users and (passive) subjects of the technology developed based on the data.', 'Table 3 lists these various stakeholders, and we explore their different needs and interactions with roles in our proposed structure in Section 5.', 'Focus of a Data Governance Organization The life cycle of the data and datasets we aim to govern spans many different stages, including: data creation, selection, curation, documentation, dissemination, hosting and serving, conservation, tracking, versioning, and deletion [74, 100].', 'Management of each of these different stages will impact our ability to support the values outlined in Table 1, which will also depend on the characteristics of the data along the dimensions illustrated in Table 2 and on which stakeholders are most directly involved (Table 3).', 'In order to better', 'Category Domain Genre Legal status Origin Source Modality Goals', 'Examples news, medical, legal literature, social media, articles public use,

'Specifically, our approach to data governance separates work done with the data, such as selection and curation, from work done around data access, control, and exchanges between different data actors.', 'Our focus may be seen as people-centric, narrowing in on the people represented and the users of the data, rather than on its analytics.', 'Thus, we make a distinction between Data Gover- nance, Data Sourcing, and Data Tooling as outlined in Figure 3.', 'These three directions are complementary: Data Governance pro- vides an overall structure wherein Sourcing and Tooling can come into play.', 'The governance work provides norms, frameworks, and communication mechanisms in order to e.g. help operationalize definitions of contestation in different legal contexts to allow for the development of locally relevant supporting tools, or to formalize relations between actors in different roles and parts of the world.', 'We illustrate this categorization further on three concrete aspects of data management next.', 'Data Governance supports Data Sourcing.', 'While governance focuses on data stakeholders and interacting norms, values, laws, etc., the governance structure operates over the datasets provided through data sourcing efforts, which accumulate, categorize, or- ganize, and document data for datasets.', 'Governance provides a framework for helping sourcing actors formalize rules on how the data they propose may be used and processing requirements.', 'These frameworks are designed to enable values such as representation by e.g. removing barriers to entry and lowering risk of participation in technology to enable actors with local knowledge to identify and fill gaps in available language resources within the global organiza- tion [90]; however the

privacy and consent.', 'To uphold these we need to under- stand what constitutes and be able to identify instances of Personal Identifiable Information (PII; a term used in the U.S.) and Personal Data (a term used in the U.K., E.U., and some other jurisdictions).', 'All three directions illustrated in Figure 3 come into play for this aspect: (a) governance helps guide the focus on the relevant aspects of personal information depending on the data types (Table 2), with local legal context shaping policies for what to do with that in- formation (e.g. whether it is indexed, obfuscated, accessible); (b) tooling implements these definitions into software that can look for instances of personal information at scale in large amounts of text data; (c) sourcing makes decisions on what data to prioritize based on the identified privacy risks and impact on various stakeholders.', 'Contestation and Removal of Data.', 'We also want our proposed structure to promote contestation rights and control over one’s data, in particular by allowing parties who have personal or commercial rights on data included in the organization to request its removal.', 'This aspect also exemplifies the interaction between governance and tooling responsibilities.', 'The former defines actionable guide- lines and processes for identifying what consitutes a legitimate removal request depending on the local norms and regulations of the requester and data custodian.', 'The latter needs to ensure that the data instance can be easily found and deleted in datasets.', 'In particular, deletion can only be meaningfully enacted if the gov- ernance structure ensures non-dissemination of the data; that is, if data modelers and researchers can use it without making and broadcasting their own copies.', 'This needs to rely on a combination of technical tools and, when they aren’t mature enough, signed agreements or licenses defining the parameters of their data access.', 'We describe a framework for these agreements in Section 5.', 'LANGUAGE DATA: SOCIAL, LEGAL, AND', 'TECHNICAL CONTEXT', 'Section 2 outlines the general mechanism of governance (2.1), the values supporting our effort (section 2.2), the kind of human-centric data we focus on (section 2.3), and its relationship to other aspects of data manangement (2.4).', 'Our next step is to investigate the interplay between the object of our governance effort and its broader context: the social context of language data (section 3.1), the relevant legal principles and frameworks (section 3.2), and the culture around language data use in ML and NLP (section 3.3).', 'Social Context: Social Variation and', 'Language Discrimination', 'The governance values outlined in Table 1 include inclusion & non-discrimination.', 'Section 2.1 also cautions against the risk that governance mechanisms might entrench inequalities and power disparities if those are not explicitly taken into account.', 'In order to apply these values and avoid those risks in the context of language data, we need to consider its social dimension.', 'Here, we review', 'Most named human languages are collections of language vari- eties with differences that stem from demographic factors such as education, geography, race, and socio-economic class [82].', 'However, there is a common misunderstanding that there are well-defined boundaries between languages, each with only a single grammar, lexicon, and orthography, and this has resulted in the stigmatiza- tion of the language varieties not associated with status and power [58, 62, 94, 114], negatively impacting speakers’s access to social infrastructures (e.g. schools [36, 69], courtrooms [118]).', 'This misunderstanding permeates in modern NLP practices.', 'For instance, texts which display sociolinguistic variation, e.g., social media text, are often labelled as “noisy”, while text from prestige variants are deemed “clean”.', 'Such politics of dirt [44] reveal atti- tudes that stigmatize minority language variants [58, 62, 114] (as well as demeaning the people that speak them) whilst obscuring values and information signaled through dialectal use of language [115].', 'Clean” text additionally has been misrepresented as being “unbiased” against any community—a notion that has been strongly contested [22, 73, 130].', 'Unsurprisingly, gendered and racial dispari- ties have been documented in a number of language technologies [37, 79, 141], and processes of creating resources and technologies may further entrench such disparities [25, 38, 144].', 'For more detail see [53].', 'While social and linguistic discrimination do not originate or end in language technologies, such technologies do engage in society as sociotechnical systems that are imbued with values [18], and it is therefore important to consider their role in discrimination, and the ways in which values of non-discrimination can be implemented when governing data.', 'To this effect, we should be cognizant of the existing linguistic discrimination present in our societies [118] and be careful not to inadvertently replicate them [132, 133].', 'In the context of the various interactions of data governance, sourcing, and tooling mentioned in Section 2.4, this requires prioritizing the needs of currently under-represented language communities in their sourcing efforts, promoting notions of data quality that do not confound noise with sociolinguistic variation [131], and explicitly including and giving a say in the various governance choices to speakers of all language variants.', 'The role of these data advocates is further outlined in Section 5.', 'Legal Context: Rights and Regulations Figure 2 presents laws and regulations as one of the pillars of governance.', 'In particular, the notion of protected rights can help us understand how the guiding values presented in Table 1 are understood and regulated in various legal contexts.', 'The global landscape of relevant laws is vast, but in this section we provide a brief overview of how the values of just rewards, attribution, and contestation are related to the property rights, consent and pri- vacy - to privacy rights, and non-discrimination - to user rights.', 'First, we examine property rights for language data creators.', 'In the U.S., property rights are often thought of as a “bundle of sticks” [66].', 'That is, property rights are composed of different types of rights: the right to profit from the property (i.e., receive just', 'Data Governance in the Age of Large-Scale Data-Driven Language Technology', 'FAccT ’22, June 21–24, 2022, Seoul, Republic of Korea', 'For example, an artist is entitled to fully profit from their work, or to remove it from circulation at any time.', 'This bundle of rights comes with some common limitations.', 'Copyright, trademarks, and patents can expire and “fair use” exemptions to copyright exist to allow certain uses of copyrighted data deemed socially beneficial, such as keeping content from disappearing [84].', 'In the context of ML, there is an ongoing debate about whether and when using copyrighted data for training models constitutes “fair use” [85].', 'The U.S. Copyright Office recently issued an exemption to liability for removing digital rights management software for the purposes of text and data mining for non-commercial research.7 Japan and Europe have passed similar legislation making it easier to use data for text and data mining for research purpose 9; this tension between social benefits from allowing re-use of data and the social harms to data creators has led some in the U.S. to call this a “fair use crisis” [127].', 'The role of a governance structure will be to help data creators, hosts, and modelers navigate these tensions by providing locally relevant frameworks for contestation and use case restrictions.', 'Second, we examine privacy rights of data creators.', 'The view of privacy protection based on data as property [75, 119, 129] has been criticized as placing a substantial burden on the free flow of in- formation, while potentially not improving privacy protections [78].', 'An alternative approach to privacy is restricting the processing of “personal data”, as it is done in the E.U.’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) [49].', 'This approach hinges on defining what is “personal”, and how that interacts with “publicly available”.', 'For digital language data, a big issue is that most longer texts are unique and difficult to anonymize [31, 81, 96], and by themselves could identify people: e.g. a simple search could identify the author of a tweet, who willingly made the authorship information public.', 'Since that author may not be aware of the visibility of their language data and conceptions of the social benefits (or lack thereof) of various research practices [54], privacy legislation such as GDPR may re- quire that data be used with (revocable) consent, and for the specific purposes that are clearly explained to the data subjects, who should also have the right to delete or rectify existing records (so as to enable e.g. factual corrections, updates to the previously accurate records, or the ‘right to be forgotten’).', 'Given that trained ML mod- els might be queried for specific information about individuals [26], a governance model would have to consider not only whether and how to remove specific instances from its datasets, but also how to minimize the risk of memorization when sharing the data for model training and development.', 'Third, we examine user rights.', 'Depending on the jurisdiction, there may be an orthogonal set of laws that aims to ensure the rights of the users of models created from the data.', 'A number of prior works, particularly from a U.S.-centric perspective, have con- nected ML to legal frameworks for human rights, especially anti- discrimination [47, 48, 64, 70, 72, 140, 142, 146].', 'These works often focus on the difficulties of constraining algorithmic discrimina- tion in many contexts, proposing alternative legal frameworks that', 'IP/european

models are more fair – and respect rights like equal protec- tion, anti-discrimination, or constraints on arbitrary enforcement.', 'For example, New York City now regulates automated employment algorithms and would require yearly bias audits.10 However, the effectiveness of these relatively new laws has yet to be tested, and in the past governments themselves have tried to leverage ML systems in potential violations of human rights.', 'We refer the reader to cited works for more in-depth analysis of these issues, including: accessibility rights, 13 a right to explanation, 14 and a right to a certain level of performance.', 'Data governance supports these user rights by allowing marginalized populations better control over how they are represented in the data used to train ML systems in an effort to lessen algorithmic discrimination, and by supporting auditability of these systems to promote accountability [4].', 'Machine Learning Context: Challenges and', 'Incentives', 'One of the major challenges in creating a data governance structure for ML datasets lies in the limited amount of research on this subject within the ML community.', 'Very recent research — most published within the last year — has begun to analyze dataset values [18, 40], question assumptions around dataset use [100], unpack what is represented in ML datasets [43, 88, 124] and establish basics of how an organized dataset lifecycle might proceed [74].', 'These just begin to scratch the surface of what well-defined data systems may look like in ML.', 'We see several reasons for the limited attention to data gover- nance in ML to date.', 'First, the mainstream ML research focuses predominantly on improvements to the model architecture, training procedure, and (hyper)parameters

(see Section 2.4).', 'Given the importance of conferences in the field, we may hope that these paper checklists will have a significant role to play in spreading norms and best practices of data curation and documentation.', 'Still, within this context, comparatively little attention is paid to the later stages of the data life cycle (see Section 2.3), or to data management models that intentionally include data subjects.', 'We review common approaches to hosting and distributing ML data in Section 4.', 'EFFORTS AND CHALLENGES IN ML DATA', 'GOVERNANCE', 'Despite its unquestionable importance in contributing towards higher-quality LLMs and stakeholder agency, explicit data gover- nance remains a relatively new field of practice in the ML and NLP communities.', 'In this Section,

with goals and priorities similar to ours.', 'Centralized Dataset Management.', 'Perhaps the most common method for managing NLP datasets is for the developers them- selves to host the data upon release on platforms such as GitHub and personal websites.', 'Commonly used larger organizations in- clude Microsoft Research Open Data and Allen Institute for AI Datasets, as well as consortia such as the Linguistic Data Consor- tium (LDC), European Language Resources Association (ELRA) and CLARIN [76], which aim to centralize and standardize access to textual resources for members of the community.', 'An advantage of such centralized repositories is that members can access a wide range of datasets that persist unchanged over time.', 'For example, any researcher who downloads the popular OntoNotes will have the same version as other researchers, enabling reproducibility and fair comparisons.', 'There are also downsides (such as membership cost or time lags), but critically for this work, there is no place', 'Data subjects and providers generally do not have visibility into the data decisions, nor recourse to address how they are represented, and centralized decisions regarding content do not necessarily account for knowledge local to where the data instance is sourced.', 'Public Dataset Repositories.', 'In recent years public repositories of datasets, like the UCI ML Repository [45] and the Hugging Face Dataset Repository [86], have become popular.', 'These repositories resemble centralized dataset management, but rely primarily on user contributions, both to source datasets and to govern them.', 'For example, dataset submitters must independently determine whether or not they have appropriate legal grounds to use the data, something they frequently lack the resources or expertise to do.', 'In practice, compliance is hard to enforce, and while datasets are increasingly accompanied by datasheets [59] and similar docu- mentation, navigating the legal structures involved is not always straightforward.', 'Public repositories do present a unique opportu- nity to help harmonize emerging standards around documenta- tion [91] mentioned in Section 3.3, but they are structurally unable to support the oversight and management that are essential to our purposes.', 'Our values of autonomy, consent, and contestation are difficult if not practically impossible for public dataset repositories, due to the full reliance on self-governance by dataset submitters (but see the Wikimedia model for related mechanisms for content curation, Section 4).', 'Open Data Initiatives.', 'In NLP, open data initiatives involve col- lecting, processing, and sharing data that is public, but inaccessible or difficult to use [57].', 'Some prominent open data initiatives have developed in response to the practice at many companies of training ML models on unreleased data, including OpenWebText [63], which seeks to replicate the dataset that GPT-2 [112] was trained on; Book- Corpu [57] and Smashword [9], which seek to replicate the formerly public BookCorpus dataset [145]; and LAION-400M [125] which seeks to replicate the WebImageText dataset that CLIP and DALL-E were trained with [110].', 'Another form of data replication effort seeks to provide public access to previously privately held data.', 'Allen AI institute, enabling other scholars to study it and use it for training their own models.', 'Open data initia- tives meet many of our desiderata for data governance, but possess some key omissions.', 'Critically, the goals of reproducible research that underlie the public recording of datasets are inherently in ten- sion with the need to update datasets to accommodate requests to remove personal information [121], and unredacted copies may circulate for years [35].', 'Example: Distributed Data Governance in the Wikimedia Project.', 'The Wikimedia projects offer a wealth of experience in highly collaborative and largely self-regulated data curation [56], similar to the goals in the proposed governance structure.', 'The core stake- holders map to the proposed governance structure in Figure 1 as follows: the many

(data modelers).', 'The Wikimedia projects face many of the same tensions that would face governance of global digital language data, such as diverse needs and goals of editors [109], the need to navigate varying local laws such as “freedom of panorama” [138] when determining whether an image can be hosted [39], and how they are situated within existing power im- balances [135].', 'For example, to create some consistency for editors and end-users of Wikimedia data, the data is governed in part through content licenses.', 'Content licenses vary in attribution requirements between projects, but restrict contributors’ rights on how their work is used.', 'This can be in conflict with cultural values, e.g., in the case of indigenous communities that are generally underrepresented on Wikipedia but have concerns about how their knowledge might be exploited if shared [28, 29].', 'To ensure that the content adheres to the chosen licenses (and other regulations [34]), editors have written policies (norms as in Section 2.2) that are constantly evolving and being contested themselves [14, 24].', 'Similar to the proposed DSO, the success of the Wikimedia editor community is facilitated by a large ecosystem of tools [61, 97] (as in Section 2.4) such as APIs, dumps, database replicas, and various cloud environments that can be used by tool developers to provide local access to this data [33].', 'The ability for the community to build the tools required for data governance has been crucial to their success at scale [67].', 'A NEW DATA GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE Let us now review the needs we have identified for a governance structure in Sections 2, 3, and 4.', 'We want an organization driven by a set of guiding values outlined in Table 1, and notably the inclusion & representation of all categories of stakeholders identified in Table 3, in a fashion that fosters equitable access across social, cultural and geographical contexts (Section 3.1).', 'In so doing, the governance structure needs to account for the complexity and diversity of corresponding legal contexts (3.2).', 'We reviewed some issues and promising directions around the culture of data use in ML (3.3) and current approaches to data management in the field (4), and found coordination across stakeholders following the desiderata detailed above to be a particular challenge.', 'The need to collect, share, access, and define norms, management, policies, guidelines, and values around the use of data suggests a structure with multiple categories of distributed actors prioritizing different aspects and communicating with one another for align- ment on end goals, legal issues, values, and interoperability.', 'To that end, we propose a data governance structure with six main actors, whose roles and relationships are summarized in Figure 1.', 'The actors additionally interact with Data Sourcing and Data Tooling, as discussed in Section 2.4. In this Section, we start by describing the specific roles of the data governance entities involved in this structure.', 'We then review the relationships between these entities through two lenses: the journey of the data through the struc- ture from its initial creators to the data modelers and the role of the DSO in formalizing frameworks and aggregating feedback and expressions of the various stakeholders’ needs, especially with the aim of fostering the values in Table 1.', 'Data Governance Entities Table 4 summarizes the roles around which we organize the governance structure; specific entities may take one or more of these roles at various times (e.g., a data mod- eler may also make their own dataset and entrust it back to a data host as data provider).', 'Figure 1 maps some of these roles to tradi- tional categorization of data governance, including data steward and data custodian.', 'We review each of these roles next.', 'Our effort toward defining data governance roles starts with ask- ing where the data is found, and whose rights need to be accounted for.', 'Data Rights-holders are varied: they can be individuals, orga- nizations or companies.', 'An individual who wrote on social media, for example, might have legally protected privacy rights on their language data used in a dataset (Section 3.2), and organizations such as radio stations, newspapers, or content platforms have prop- erty rights on the data they create or host.', 'In general, the Data Rights-holders correspond to the data subjects and data creators categories of stakeholders in Table 3 and represent the focus of the values of contestation, consent, privacy, attribution, and just rewards described in Table 1.', 'In particular, Rights-holders can in- form how specific items of their language data may be used, in accordance with legal protections and values.', 'Data is brought into our proposed governance structure by Data Providers.', 'Companies that host or create language data can act as Data Providers, as can research organizations that create datasets from public or private data or archival institutions that work on preserving online or offline content (e.g., the Internet Archive).', 'The Data Providers can be identical to or separate from the Data Rights- holders, and can either fully specify what the data they bring into the governance structure may be used for, or specify it to the extent permitted by the original rights-holders.', 'Data is served by Data Hosts who gather and hold data from the Data Providers so as to meet the goals of the governance project and comply with legal requirements.', 'This data is in turn made available to Data Modelers.', 'Data Hosts maintain their own, possibly post- processed version of the language data offered by data providers, and can decide which data they want to host (i.e. they may decline to host some of the data offered by a data provider).', 'Depending on the jurisdiction of the Data Host and Data Provider, the Hosts may need a specific legal basis for holding certain kind of data or being eligible for some of the research exceptions outlined in Section 3.2, which may go from being a nonprofit organization to having some form of public interest mission.', 'As outlined in Section 2.4, Data Sourc- ing happens at the intersection between Data Providers and Data Hosts; the diversity and representativity of the data available to the governance organization will depend on the ability of the hosts to establish relationships and support the need of the greater variety of data providers.', 'Notably, this is easier when there is a degree of proximity between the hosts and providers so they have similar social and legal contexts —which motivates the need to have data hosts around the world to foster linguistic and cultural diversity of the available language data.', 'This proximity is also necessary to enacting meaningful contestation rights at the Data Host level, as it will allow the requester (Data Rights-holders) and the enacter (Data Host) to share similar understandings of the notion and rely on a similar legal framework (as the extraterritorial applicability', 'FAccT ’22, June 21–24, 2022, Seoul, Republic of Korea', 'Jernite et al.', 'Data Rights-holders Data Providers Data Hosts', 'Decide whether to share their data.', 'Make data available to others.', 'Gather and hold data aligned to constraints defined within the governance structure.', 'Specify dataset values and requirements.', 'Data Modelers Data Stewardship Org.', 'Discussion space for all actors involved.', 'Data Helpers', 'Ensure decisions respect rights and regulations', 'Table 4: Actors within the proposed Data Governance structure', 'Data Modelers + Data dissemination Data Hosts Data Hosts + Data Providers', 'Specific use case restrictions Data dissemination Conditions for serving data Rights with respect to derived products', 'Table 5: Binding agreements needed in the Data Governance Structure.', 'GDPR around the world is still an open question).', 'The last category of distributed actors of our proposed data gov- ernance organization are the Data Modelers, who can request access to data held by the Data Hosts to use according to the re- quirements set forth by the Data Rights-holders, Data Providers, and Data Hosts.', 'The Data Modelers have their own data needs, including visibility of the data available across the data hosts, and ease of processing (e.g. through a unified format for all data sources).', 'Researchers may also need some degree of replicability for experi- ments run using the data held with the governance organization (see Section 3.3), which needs to be understood in the context of the contestation rights within the organization.', 'Finally, a Data Stewardship Organization provides a discus- sion space for all the above-mentioned actors and connections in- volved, communicating between Hosts, Providers, Data Advocates, and Data Rights-holders.', 'The DSO brings together representatives of all of the other roles, and is supported by Data Helpers, includ- ing lawyers and legal scholars representing all regions where the governance organization operates and advocacy groups focused on representing the interests of populations affected by data use and technology 18.', 'The role of the DSO in establishing and formal- izing relationships between the actors is further outlined below, and it also serves as a central repository of technical tools, relevant documentations, and as a facilitator of interoperability.', 'Given this role, both the input of the Lawyers and of the Data Advocates is requested on new choices to account for both relevant regulations and their impact on the values listed in Table 1.', 'Journey of the Data.', 'Before eventually being used for research or development of NLP system, the data follows a journey from its original creators, to the Data Providers who introduce it to the governance structure, to the Data Hosts that aggregate various sources, to the Data Modelers.', 'Each of these transfers and nodes in the path defines its own agreements between parties.', 'In particular, these agreements are structured around the notion of contractual', 'In the exchanges between Data Hosts and Data Providers, Providers make data available, and if they have full rights on the data, they may specify use conditions.', 'Some selection criteria might include research only, or use by organizations that meet certain criteria (such as non-profit status, or value statements).', 'These re- strictions may be explicitly set down in a license agreement signed by the Host and the Provider (Table 5).', 'As an additional incentive for Providers to share their data, this license may require the Host to give the Provider access to any by-product of their data, such as analyses or processed versions (e.g. with PII removed; see Section 2.4).', 'If the Provider is proposing data that is curated from external sources, especially text that is regulated by general data protection laws, there is also an implicit relationship between Data Host and Rights-holders.', 'In particular, the Data Host will be bound to honor contestation requests when an individual finds that their private information, or data that they have a commercial right to, is included in data shared with the Host without their explicit con- sent.', 'The Host would then be required to remove the particular data items from their dataset.', 'This aspect requires Hosts to share data via access restrictions or binding agreements, as opposed to allowing copies to be freely downloaded and proliferated.', 'Finally, the exchange between Data Hosts and Data Model- ers is bound by another set of licensing agreements, which need to reflect the restrictions flowing down from the Data Providers and other Rights-holders, any additional constraints expressed by the Data Host, and a non-dissemination clause.', 'The Modeler may be required to obtain a fresh version of any dataset reflecting the most recent version of the data host after a fixed amount of time.', 'The latter two are essential to ensure that data that has been deleted from a Host to answer a contestation request, or whose license with the Data Provider has expired, does not remain available.', 'Role of the DSO.', 'While the DSO itself is not a direct party in any of the agreements outlined above, its role is to facilitate inter- actions between all entities involved and assure interoperability between actors.', 'For example, Data Providers might have reason to propose their own license, especially to support values that are misrepresented in legal frameworks relevant to them 19.', 'In such cases, respecting our value of inclusivity and the local knowledge of the Providers on how best to represent their community’s in- terests means allowing them to use their own licensing in their interactions with Data Hosts rather then requiring them to use one designed by the DSO.', 'Conversely, some of the Data Providers,', 'Data 4 Black Lives, Our Data Bodies are two such organizations in the US.', 'Maori Data Sovereignty License', 'Data Governance in the Age of Large-Scale Data-Driven Language Technology', 'FAccT ’22, June 21–24, 2022, Seoul, Republic of Korea', 'DSO standard data license would foster inclusion.', 'We provide our proposal for such an agreement between the Data Hosts and Data Providers in Appendix B.', 'This tension reflects the governance trade-off between harmo- nization and independence mentioned in Section 2.1. One additional complexity of allowing Hosts and Providers to use custom licenses arises when a Host aggregates data from several Providers to share with a Data Modeler.', 'Without any categorization of the various Provider licenses, the Host would have to either develop a new custom license for each aggregation of data sources, or leave it to the Modeler to understand the interplay of the various constraints.', 'We address these issues through a dual approach.', 'First, the DSO provides a license template for use in exchanges between the Data Providers and Data Hosts.', 'Second, the DSO maintains a taxonomy of licenses designed to support rules for aggregating use case re- strictions from Providers for the agreement between the Hosts and Modelers, to be updated when a new license appears that is not easily categorized.20', 'This approach exemplifies the general role of the Data Steward- ship Organization at various points of exchange in the governance organization, in its two roles as a fallback mechanism or default option for actors that do not have the resources to develop their own processes, and as an enabler of interoperability between pro- cesses when they do: whether the process in question corresponds to the license agreement between the Data Host and Data Modelers, the framework for identifying a legitimate contestation request between a Data Host and Rights-holders, or the technical tools used for identifying personal information or managing access to data.', 'DISCUSSION We have introduced an approach to data governance, grounded in an ongoing year-long case study that coordinates data inter- nationally to train a Large Language Model.', 'Critical aspects of the governance structure include protocols for achieving differ- ent values, working with established norms, and contending with the different laws applicable across datasets.', 'This requires coor- dinating multiple stake-holders and rights-holders.', 'Our approach is modular, where different parties focus on different aspects of the dataset processing and sharing, interconnecting data providers, data hosts, and data developers.', 'This is coordinated by a Data Stew- ardship Organization that develops appropriate management plans, access restrictions, and legal scholarship.', 'A complementary Data Tooling efforts help to provide resources common to the legal and ethical needs of the participating institutions, We have found that one of the most difficult hurdles is developing legal agreements for Providers, Hosts, and Modelers that respect the laws and copyrights set forth in the data, as well as the laws of the institutions’ regions.', 'We tackle this problem through the lens of stated governance values, which inform the kinds of agreements that are necessary.', 'CLARIN (Section 4) uses a restricted version of such a taxonomy for non-commercial data only [76]', 'REFERENCES', 'REGULATION (EU) 2018/1725 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE

and definitions discussed live.', 'A.1 Overview of Approach An initial seed set of values for the data governance project were first implicitly expressed by the project planners, in our initial planning documents.', 'These documents were a product of roughly a handful of people: The group co-leads (3 people) who primarily authored them, and a set of people who provided comments and additions after the planning documents were shared more broadly within the BigScience effort.', 'Discussions and debates within the larger working group (around 10 people) at our regular meetings refined and expanded on these values in light of what everyone in the group wanted to prioritize in the project.', 'For example, notes on needing to take care to make sure the data wasn’t inappropriately reductive towards some populations was tentatively labelled as inclusion, and with the working group, this eventually evolved into a value of representativeness, defined as capturing the full diversity of human language use.', 'Similarly, the working group together decided on the best terms to use for the different value proposals.', 'Our goal was to align on shared values to help prioritize different aspects of the work and to have some guidance to inform the decisions and potential disagreements we’d have as a working group moving forward.', 'We recognized this was especially important as more people became involved, and so sought to have a basic set of values in place within the first 2 months of the project.', 'Notably, prioritizing different aspects of inclusion was a strongly shared goal across participants.', 'A.2 Steps To create the initial set of values, we first reflected on the fact that no one would be operating as a “blank slate” in this working group; that we all had our own values, and our own goals and motivations in working on the project.', 'As such, we focused on identifying what values we were already bringing to the table.', 'This was an exercise of making the implicit explicit, and required annotating the initial planning documents alongside larger working group discussions.', 'First, we organized all documents and notes for the initial creation of BigScience and the working group in chronological order.', 'Then, the co-lead went through each, highlighting specifically mentioned values – such as geographical diversity – as well as annotating implicit values expressed in the text by the various authors and commenters.', 'For the latter approach, the terms used for the annotations served as placeholders for further discussion within the larger working group.', 'Then, the working group discussed the highlighted values and value annotations in light of their surrounding text, what the implicit ideas behind the text were, what we all felt we should be doing relevant to the value, and what we were all understanding and not understanding.', 'Throughout these discussions, we crafted definitions live for what these value terms meant.', 'Once the definitions were in place and generally agreed upon, we discussed the specific terms used as value labels, and in some cases changed them, or broke up definitions into different components to identify more than one value.', 'Screenshots representative of how these discussions evolved, in chronological order, are depicted in Figures 4, 5, 6, and 7', 'A.3 Growing Over the course of the project, the size of the working group grew.', 'From an initial set of around 10 people, we became a group of 50+ (some more involved than others), with some individuals taking on different roles as needs arose (for example, legal scholars and others interested worked on crafting a Data Host-Provider Agreement).', 'All participants were introduced to the grounding values and

made it possible to extract ever more complex language statistics from growing numbers of text and speech records to drastically improve the performance and applicability of data-driven Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems.', 'As a result, language technologies have become an integral part of daily lived experience in a greater variety of areas both online (Internet search engines, content recommenda- tion and moderation in social media) and offline (automatic transla- tion and speech transcription in official documents and interactions) to the point of becoming near ubiquitous.', 'Consequently, through being so deeply embedded into modern human life, the governance of these new forms of infrastructure —or the lack thereof —has come to exert power over individuals’ and communities’ lives and access to technology.', 'These practical applications of language technology are increas- ingly reliant on approaches based on trained Large Language Mod- els (LLMs) [23, 41, 104, 111], whereby models are first exposed to as large and varied a collection of language data as possible with the aim of extracting “general” properties of a language of interest.', 'This first step then makes it easier to fine-tune models that learn to perform a range of “specific” NLP tasks more efficiently in that same language setting.', 'As such, the language corpora used to train LLMs need to meet significantly different requirements than the more purpose-specific datasets that have hitherto supported major advances in data-driven NLP.', 'Indeed, while concerns of “generality” are not new to the field of Machine Learning (ML), this two-stage approach of (pre-)training followed by further training and fine- tuning for a task has given them a new scope; where the properties identified by the model are expected to hold across a much greater variety of tasks, domains, and settings as long as they are in the same “language(s)” as the text it was pre-trained on.', 'However, whereas recent advances in modeling and hardware have increased the data training capacity of LLMs, increasing from Wikipedia-scale corpora to close to three orders of magni- tude more, 1 devising methods for carefully identifying, obtaining, and managing a sufficiently large and diverse collection of lan- guage data to take full advantage of this increased capacity has remained an elusive endeavor.', 'Indeed, in order to support such ambitions of generality, this collection would need to include lan- guage data from a great diversity of carefully curated sources to', 'Figure 1: Overview of the Data Stewardship Organization and Actors', 'English (further discussed by Blasi et al.', 'This requires a more intentional approach to collecting and working with data, but designing a data gover- nance structure to appropriately handle such varied data sources while respecting the rights and interests of their stakeholders presents a unique challenge that is only partly met by existing language data management approaches.', 'To better address these needs, we propose a new model for data governance in the form of a Data Stewardship Organization (DSO, see Figure 1 diagram) working in conjunction with related stake- holders and rights holders.', 'The DSO primarily aims to foster the agency of data subjects and rights holders with respect to the uses of their data as the amount and diversity of contexts for this data grows.', 'It is designed to enable multiple stakeholders to collaborate on the decisions that go into building and managing a collection of language resources, so as to meet goals of responsible data gover- nance at a scale and diversity that may support this new generation of data-driven language technology.', 'While our work is grounded by the goal of training a multilingual LLM, we also note that many of the constraints and impacts of the design choices proposed in this work hold across a greater variety of uses of human-centric research and development data.', 'We endeavor to also consider these related applications when relevant.', 'Research Context and Paper Outline The research presented in this paper is conducted in the context of a year-long, distributed, collaborative workshop on Large Language Models.', 'The workshop brings together over 1000 participants from 60 countries and is organized into smaller working groups focused on key aspects of the topic, including model architecture and training procedure, evaluation of performance and social biases, multilinguality, and data sourcing and governance.', 'Part of the value in this project is making connections between different fields of knowledge that are not normally very connected, and do so in a practical case study that pursues ethical, legal and technical goals all together.', 'The following sections present the findings of the data gover- nance group in our effort to build a governance structure to manage', 'The Chinchilla model of Hoffmann

technical context for using language data, and Section 4 reviews current approaches to data management in ML/NLP and in Wikimedia, a distributed collaborative project whose goals and requirements have significant overlap with ours.', 'Finally, Section 5 describes our proposed governance structure, describing its various actors and outlining a framework for their interactions.', 'DISTRIBUTED GOVERNANCE: VALUES', 'AND DEFINITIONS', 'Our proposed organization aims to promote better data governance in the context of data-driven language technology research and development.', 'To support this project, we start by reviewing litera- ture on the processes and mechanisms of distributed governance (Section 2.1), and in particular on the values that underpin them (2.2).', 'We then position our governance proposal with respect to these processes by defining both its object, namely human-centric data used in NLP (2.3), and its relationship to other aspects of data management (2.4).', 'Approaching Collaborative Governance:', 'Theories and Mechanisms', 'Governance is a nebulous concept, defined by the Commission on Global Governance [32] as “the sum of the many ways individuals and institutions, public and private, manage their common affairs”.', 'Topics such as technology governance have received increasing at- tention in the last few decades as the digital transformation of the late 20th and early 21st century has increased the speed at which technological innovation changes people’s lives around the world [139], leading to extensive analyses of the processes, dynam- ics, and particular challenges of global governance.', 'One such challenge has proven to be the impossibility of gov- erning any individual subject in isolation in a fully integrated world, a phenomenon studied under the name of regime com- plexes [99].', 'Keohane and Victor [77] study the case of the regime complex for climate change, whose global governance happens at the intersection of e.g., UN and local legal regimes and bilateral agreements and spans topics such as trade regulation, technology, or geoengineering.', 'Consequently, governance efforts need to ac- count for fragmentation when organizations in inter-connected areas make choices that have bearing on each other; by examin- ing these connections and positioning any decision within a dense network of issues

language data, paying special attention to its use in ML datasets.', 'In the ML world, data refers to any digital representation of acts, facts or other information in forms that include text, images, video, or audio recordings [2, 100, 134], which may be collated or formed into more complex information [13].', 'It is often described via analogy as food and fuel for ML systems, water and oil as an AI resource, and increasingly as records of human activity [128].', 'As such, it is a fundamental catalyst for the creation of artificial intelli- gence systems [13], used for training, developing and/or testing AI systems in the form of datasets, an organized collection of data for a defined task [100].', 'The proposed data governance structure introduced in this paper focuses on digital language data, which includes text from news and academic articles, reports, white papers, blogs, social media posts, radio shows, and digitized books.', 'All such data is created by a person, group of people, or an organization who may hold the rights to that data.', 'All of these dimensions of the language data and datasets it’s organized as have bearing on the governance choices (see Table 2 for examples of categories).', 'Of particular sensitivity in data governance is human-centric data, data that additionally refers to or represents the ideas of a person.', 'Some kinds of textual data such as weather reports are less likely to harm an individual in case of lax governance or misuse, but human-centric data brings with it concerns around how an individual is represented, how that representation may affect them, the represented individual’s consent, and other fundamental and legal rights [1].', 'The specific risks to be considered depend on the individual’s relationship to the

than on its analytics.', 'Thus, we make a distinction between Data Gover- nance, Data Sourcing, and Data Tooling as outlined in Figure 3.', 'These three directions are complementary: Data Governance pro- vides an overall structure wherein Sourcing and Tooling can come into play.', 'The governance work provides norms, frameworks, and communication mechanisms in order to e.g. help operationalize definitions of contestation in different legal contexts to allow for the development of locally relevant supporting tools, or to formalize relations between actors in different roles and parts of the world.', 'We illustrate this categorization further on three concrete aspects of data management next.', 'Data Governance supports Data Sourcing.', 'While governance focuses on data stakeholders and interacting norms, values, laws, etc., the governance structure operates over the datasets provided through data sourcing efforts, which accumulate, categorize, or- ganize, and document data for

Identifiable Information (PII; a term used in the U.S.) and Personal Data (a term used in the U.K., E.U., and some other jurisdictions).', 'All three directions illustrated in Figure 3 come into play for this aspect: (a) governance helps guide the focus on the relevant aspects of personal information depending on the data types (Table 2), with local legal context shaping policies for what to do with that in- formation (e.g. whether it is indexed, obfuscated, accessible); (b) tooling implements these definitions into software that can look for instances of personal information at scale in large amounts of text data; (c) sourcing makes decisions on what data to prioritize based on the identified privacy risks and impact on various stakeholders.', 'Contestation and Removal of Data.', 'We also want our proposed structure to promote contestation rights and control over one’s data, in particular by allowing parties who have personal or commercial rights on data included in the organization to request its removal.', 'This aspect also exemplifies the interaction between governance and tooling responsibilities.', 'The former defines actionable guide- lines and processes for identifying what consitutes a legitimate removal request depending on the local norms and regulations of the requester and data custodian.', 'The latter needs to ensure that the data instance can be easily found and deleted in datasets.', 'In particular, deletion can only be meaningfully enacted if the gov- ernance structure ensures non-dissemination of the data; that is, if data modelers and researchers can use it without making and broadcasting their own copies.', 'This needs to rely on a combination of technical tools and, when they aren’t mature enough, signed agreements or licenses defining the parameters of their data access.', 'We describe a framework for these agreements in Section 5.', 'LANGUAGE DATA: SOCIAL, LEGAL, AND', 'TECHNICAL CONTEXT', 'Section 2 outlines the general mechanism of governance (2.1), the values supporting our effort (section 2.2), the kind of human-centric data we focus on (section 2.3), and its relationship to other aspects of data manangement

principles and frameworks (section 3.2), and the culture around language data use in ML and NLP (section 3.3).', 'Social Context: Social Variation and', 'Language Discrimination', 'The governance values outlined in Table 1 include inclusion & non-discrimination.', 'Section 2.1 also cautions against the risk that governance mechanisms might entrench inequalities and power disparities if those are not explicitly taken into account.', 'In order to apply these values and avoid those risks in the context of language data, we need to consider its social dimension.', 'Here, we review', 'Most named human languages are collections of language vari- eties with differences that stem from demographic factors such as education, geography, race, and socio-economic class [82].', 'However, there is a common misunderstanding that there are well-defined boundaries between languages, each with only a single grammar, lexicon, and orthography, and this has resulted in the stigmatiza- tion of the language varieties not associated with status and power [58, 62, 94, 114], negatively impacting speakers’s access to social infrastructures (e.g. schools [36, 69], courtrooms [118]).', 'This misunderstanding permeates in modern NLP practices.', 'For instance, texts which display sociolinguistic variation, e.g., social media text, are often labelled as “noisy”, while text from prestige variants are deemed “clean”.', 'Such politics of dirt [44] reveal atti- tudes that stigmatize minority language variants [58, 62, 114] (as well as demeaning the people that speak them) whilst obscuring values and information signaled through dialectal use of language [115].', 'Clean” text additionally has been misrepresented as being “unbiased” against any community—a notion that has been strongly contested [22, 73, 130].', 'Unsurprisingly, gendered and racial dispari- ties have been documented in a number of language technologies [37, 79, 141], and processes of creating resources and technologies may further entrench such disparities [25, 38, 144].', 'For more detail see [53].', 'While social and linguistic discrimination do not originate or end in language technologies, such technologies do engage in society as sociotechnical systems that are imbued with values [18], and it is therefore important to consider their role in discrimination, and the ways in which values of non-discrimination can be implemented when governing data.', 'To this effect, we should be cognizant of the existing linguistic discrimination present in our societies [118] and be careful not to inadvertently replicate them [132, 133].', 'In the context of the various interactions of data governance, sourcing, and tooling mentioned in Section 2.4, this requires prioritizing the needs of currently under-represented language communities in their sourcing efforts, promoting notions of data quality that do not confound noise with sociolinguistic variation [131], and explicitly including and giving a say in the various governance choices to speakers of all language variants.', 'The role of these data advocates is further outlined in Section 5.', 'Legal Context: Rights and Regulations Figure 2 presents laws and regulations as one of the pillars of governance.', 'In particular, the notion of protected rights can help us understand how the guiding values presented in Table 1 are understood and regulated in various legal contexts.', 'The global landscape of relevant laws is vast, but in this section we provide a brief overview of how the values of just rewards, attribution, and contestation are related to the property rights, consent and pri- vacy - to privacy rights, and non-discrimination - to user rights.', 'First, we examine property rights for language data

to fully profit from their work, or to remove it from circulation at any time.', 'This bundle of rights comes with some common limitations.', 'Copyright, trademarks, and patents can expire and “fair use” exemptions to copyright exist to allow certain uses of copyrighted data deemed socially beneficial, such as keeping content from disappearing [84].', 'In the context of ML, there is an ongoing debate about whether and when using copyrighted data for training models constitutes “fair use” [85].', 'The U.S. Copyright Office recently issued an exemption to liability for removing digital rights management software for the purposes of text and data mining for non-commercial research.7 Japan and Europe have passed similar legislation making it easier to use data for text and data mining for research purpose 9; this tension between social benefits from allowing re-use of data and the social harms to data creators has led some in the U.S. to call this a “fair use crisis” [127].', 'The role of a governance structure will be to help data creators, hosts, and modelers navigate these tensions by providing locally relevant frameworks for contestation and use case restrictions.', 'Second, we examine privacy rights of data creators.', 'The view of privacy protection based on data as property [75, 119, 129] has been criticized as placing a substantial burden on the free flow of in- formation, while potentially not improving privacy protections [78].', 'An alternative approach to privacy is restricting the processing of “personal data”, as it is done in the E.U.’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) [49].', 'This approach hinges on defining what is “personal”, and how that interacts with “publicly available”.', 'For digital language data, a big issue is that most longer texts are unique and difficult to anonymize [31, 81, 96], and by themselves could identify people: e.g. a simple search could identify the author of a tweet, who willingly made the authorship information public.', 'Since that author may not be aware of the visibility of their language data and conceptions of the social benefits (or lack thereof) of various research practices [54], privacy legislation such as GDPR may re- quire that data be used with (revocable) consent, and for the specific purposes that are clearly explained to the data subjects, who should also have the right to delete or rectify existing records (so as to enable e.g. factual corrections, updates to the previously accurate records, or the ‘right to be forgotten’).', 'Given that trained ML mod- els might be queried for specific information about individuals [26], a governance model would have to consider not only whether and how to remove specific instances from its datasets, but also how to minimize the risk of memorization when sharing the data for model training and development.', 'Third, we examine user rights.', 'Depending on the jurisdiction, there may be an orthogonal set of laws that aims to ensure the rights of the users of models created from the data.', 'A number of prior works, particularly from a U.S.-centric perspective, have con- nected ML to legal frameworks for human rights, especially anti- discrimination [47, 48, 64, 70, 72, 140, 142, 146].', 'These works often focus on the difficulties of constraining algorithmic discrimina- tion in many contexts, proposing alternative legal frameworks that', 'IP/european -parliament-approves-new-copyright-rules-for-the-internet', 'The evolving nature of human rights law, civil rights law, and ML may place more constraints on data

regulates automated employment algorithms and would require yearly bias audits.10 However, the effectiveness of these relatively new laws has yet to be tested, and in the past governments themselves have tried to leverage ML systems in potential violations of human rights.', 'We refer the reader to cited works for more in-depth analysis of these issues, including: accessibility rights, 13 a right to explanation, 14 and a right to a certain level of performance.', 'Data governance supports these user rights by allowing marginalized populations better control over how they are represented in the

for managing NLP datasets is for the developers them- selves to host the data upon release on platforms such as GitHub and personal websites.', 'Commonly used larger organizations in- clude Microsoft Research Open Data and Allen Institute for AI Datasets, as well as consortia such as the Linguistic Data Consor- tium (LDC), European Language Resources Association (ELRA) and CLARIN [76], which aim to centralize and standardize access to textual resources for members of the community.', 'An advantage of such centralized repositories is that members can access a wide range of datasets that persist unchanged over time.', 'For example, any researcher who downloads the popular OntoNotes will have the same version as other researchers, enabling reproducibility and fair comparisons.', 'There are also downsides (such as membership cost or time lags), but critically for this work, there is no place', 'Data subjects and providers generally do not have visibility into the data decisions, nor recourse to address how they are represented, and centralized decisions regarding content do not necessarily account for knowledge local to where the data instance is sourced.', 'Public Dataset Repositories.', 'In recent years public repositories of datasets, like the UCI ML Repository [45] and the Hugging Face Dataset Repository [86], have become popular.', 'These repositories resemble centralized dataset management, but rely primarily on user contributions, both to source datasets and to govern them.', 'For example, dataset submitters must independently determine whether or not they have appropriate legal grounds to use the data, something they frequently lack the resources or expertise to do.', 'In practice, compliance is hard to enforce, and while datasets are increasingly accompanied by datasheets [59] and similar docu- mentation, navigating the legal structures involved is not always straightforward.', 'Public repositories do present a unique opportu- nity to help harmonize emerging standards around documenta- tion [91] mentioned in Section 3.3, but they are structurally unable to support the oversight and management that are essential to our purposes.', 'Our values of autonomy, consent, and contestation are difficult if not practically impossible for public dataset repositories, due to the full reliance on self-governance by dataset submitters (but see the Wikimedia model for related mechanisms for content curation, Section 4).', 'Open Data Initiatives.', 'In NLP, open data initiatives involve col- lecting, processing, and sharing data that is public, but inaccessible or difficult to use [57].', 'Some prominent open data initiatives have developed in response to the practice at many companies of training ML models on unreleased data, including OpenWebText [63], which seeks to replicate the dataset that GPT-2 [112] was trained on; Book- Corpu [57] and Smashword [9], which seek to replicate the formerly public BookCorpus dataset

global digital language data, such as diverse needs and goals of editors [109], the need to navigate varying local laws such as “freedom of panorama” [138] when determining whether an image can be hosted [39], and how they are situated within existing power im- balances [135].', 'For example, to create some consistency for editors and end-users of Wikimedia data, the data is governed in part through content licenses.', 'Content licenses vary in attribution requirements between projects, but restrict contributors’ rights on how their work is used.', 'This can be in conflict with cultural values, e.g., in the case of indigenous communities that are generally underrepresented on Wikipedia but have concerns about how their knowledge might be exploited if shared [28, 29].', 'To ensure that the content adheres to the chosen licenses (and other regulations [34]), editors have written policies (norms as in Section 2.2) that are constantly evolving and being contested themselves [14, 24].', 'Similar to the proposed DSO, the success of the Wikimedia editor community is facilitated by a large ecosystem of tools [61, 97] (as in Section 2.4) such as APIs, dumps, database replicas, and various cloud environments that can be used by tool developers to provide local access to this data [33].', 'The ability for the community to build the tools required for data governance has been crucial to their success at scale [67].', 'A NEW DATA GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE Let us now review the needs we have identified for a governance structure in Sections 2, 3, and 4.', 'We want an organization driven by a set of guiding values outlined in Table 1, and notably the inclusion & representation of all categories of stakeholders identified in Table 3, in a fashion that fosters equitable access across social, cultural and geographical contexts (Section 3.1).', 'In so doing, the governance structure needs to account for the complexity and diversity of corresponding legal contexts (3.2).', 'We reviewed some issues and promising directions around the culture of data use in ML (3.3) and current approaches to data management in the field (4), and found coordination across stakeholders following the desiderata detailed above to be a particular challenge.', 'The need to collect, share, access, and define norms, management, policies, guidelines, and values around the use of data suggests a structure with multiple categories of distributed actors prioritizing different aspects and communicating with one another for align- ment on end goals, legal issues, values, and interoperability.', 'To that end, we propose a data governance structure with six main actors, whose roles and relationships are summarized in Figure 1.', 'The actors additionally interact with Data Sourcing and Data Tooling, as discussed in Section 2.4. In this Section, we start by describing the specific roles of the data governance entities involved in this structure.', 'We then review the relationships between these entities through two lenses: the journey of the data through the struc- ture from its initial creators to the data modelers and the role of the DSO in formalizing frameworks and aggregating feedback and expressions of the various stakeholders’ needs, especially with the aim of fostering the values in Table 1.', 'Data Governance Entities Table 4 summarizes the roles around which we organize the governance structure; specific entities may take one or more of these roles at various times (e.g., a data mod- eler may also make their own dataset and entrust it back to a data host as data provider).', 'Figure 1 maps some of these roles to tradi- tional categorization of data governance, including data steward and data custodian.', 'We review each of these roles next.', 'Our effort toward defining data governance roles starts with ask- ing where the data is found, and whose rights need to be accounted for.', 'Data Rights-holders are varied: they can be individuals, orga- nizations or companies.', 'An individual who wrote on social media, for example, might have legally protected privacy rights on their language data used in a dataset (Section 3.2), and organizations such as radio stations, newspapers, or content platforms have prop- erty rights on the data they create or host.', 'In general, the Data Rights-holders correspond to the data subjects and data creators categories of stakeholders in Table 3 and represent the focus of the values of contestation, consent, privacy, attribution, and just rewards described in Table 1.', 'In particular, Rights-holders can in- form how specific items of their language data may be used, in accordance with legal protections and values.', 'Data is brought into our proposed governance structure by Data Providers.', 'Companies that host or create language data can act as Data Providers, as can research organizations that create datasets from public or private data or archival institutions that work on preserving online or offline content (e.g., the Internet Archive).', 'The Data Providers can be identical to or separate from the Data Rights- holders, and can either fully specify what the data they bring into the governance structure may be used for, or specify it to the extent permitted by the original rights-holders.', 'Data is served by Data Hosts who gather and hold data from the Data Providers so as to meet the goals of the governance project and comply with legal requirements.', 'This data is in turn made available to Data Modelers.', 'Data Hosts maintain their own, possibly post- processed version of the language data offered by data providers, and can decide which data they want to host (i.e. they may decline to host some of the data offered by a data provider).', 'Depending on the jurisdiction of the Data Host and Data Provider, the Hosts may need a specific legal basis for holding certain kind of data or being eligible for some of the research exceptions outlined in Section 3.2, which may go from being a nonprofit organization to having some form of public interest mission.', 'As outlined in Section 2.4, Data Sourc- ing happens at the intersection between Data Providers and Data Hosts; the diversity and representativity of the data available to the governance organization will depend on the ability of the hosts to establish relationships and support the need of the greater variety of data providers.', 'Notably, this is easier when there is a degree of proximity between the hosts and providers so they have similar social and legal contexts —which motivates the need to have data hosts around the world to foster linguistic and cultural diversity of the available language data.', 'This proximity is also necessary to enacting meaningful contestation rights at the Data Host level, as it will allow the requester (Data Rights-holders) and the enacter (Data Host) to share similar understandings of the notion and rely on a similar legal framework (as the extraterritorial applicability', 'FAccT ’22, June 21–24, 2022, Seoul, Republic of Korea', 'Jernite et al.', 'Data Rights-holders Data Providers Data Hosts', 'Decide whether to share their data.', 'Make data available to others.', 'Gather and hold data aligned to constraints defined within the governance structure.', 'Specify dataset values and requirements.', 'Data Modelers Data Stewardship Org.', 'Discussion space for all actors involved.', 'Data Helpers', 'Ensure decisions respect rights and regulations', 'Table 4: Actors within the proposed Data Governance structure', 'Data Modelers + Data dissemination Data Hosts Data Hosts + Data Providers', 'Specific use case restrictions Data dissemination Conditions for serving data Rights with respect to derived products', 'Table 5: Binding agreements needed in the Data Governance Structure.', 'GDPR around the world is still an open question).', 'The last category of distributed actors of our proposed data gov- ernance organization are the Data Modelers, who can request access to data held by the Data Hosts to use according to the re- quirements set forth by the Data Rights-holders, Data Providers, and Data Hosts.', 'The Data Modelers have their own data needs, including visibility of the data available across the data hosts, and ease of processing (e.g. through a unified format for all data sources).', 'Researchers may also need some degree of replicability for experi- ments run using the data held with the governance organization (see Section 3.3), which needs to be understood in the context of the contestation rights within the organization.', 'Finally, a Data Stewardship Organization provides a discus- sion space for all the above-mentioned actors and connections in- volved, communicating between Hosts, Providers, Data Advocates, and Data Rights-holders.', 'The DSO brings together representatives of all of the other roles, and is supported by Data Helpers, includ- ing lawyers and legal scholars representing all regions where the governance organization operates and advocacy groups focused on representing the interests of populations affected by data use and technology 18.', 'The role of the DSO in establishing and formal- izing relationships between the actors is further outlined below, and it also serves as a central repository of technical tools, relevant documentations, and as a facilitator of interoperability.', 'Given this role, both the input of the Lawyers and of the Data Advocates is requested on new choices to account for both relevant regulations and their impact on the values listed in Table 1.', 'Journey of the Data.', 'Before eventually being used for research or development of NLP system, the data follows a journey from its original creators, to the Data Providers who introduce it to the governance structure, to the Data Hosts that aggregate various sources, to the Data Modelers.', 'Each of these transfers and nodes in the path defines its own agreements between parties.', 'In particular, these agreements are structured around the notion of contractual', 'In the exchanges between Data Hosts and Data Providers, Providers make data available, and if they have full rights on the data, they may specify use conditions.', 'Some selection criteria might include research only, or use by organizations that meet certain criteria (such as non-profit status, or value statements).', 'These re- strictions may be explicitly set down in a license agreement signed by the Host and the Provider (Table 5).', 'As an additional incentive for Providers to share their data, this license may require the Host to give the Provider access to any by-product of their data, such as analyses or processed versions (e.g. with PII removed; see Section 2.4).', 'If the Provider is proposing data that is curated from external sources, especially text that is regulated by general data protection laws, there is also an implicit relationship between Data Host and Rights-holders.', 'In particular, the Data Host will be bound to honor contestation requests when an individual finds that their private information, or data that they have a commercial right to, is included in data shared with the Host without their explicit con- sent.', 'The Host would then be required to remove the particular data items from their dataset.', 'This aspect requires Hosts to share data via access restrictions or binding agreements, as opposed to allowing copies to be freely downloaded and proliferated.', 'Finally, the exchange between Data Hosts and Data Model- ers is bound by another set of licensing agreements, which need to reflect the restrictions flowing down from the Data Providers and other Rights-holders, any additional constraints expressed by the Data Host, and a non-dissemination clause.', 'The Modeler may be required to obtain a fresh version of any dataset reflecting the most recent version of the data host after a fixed amount of time.', 'The latter two are essential to ensure that data that has been deleted from a Host to answer a contestation request, or whose license with the Data Provider has expired, does not remain available.', 'Role of the DSO.', 'While the DSO itself is not a direct party in any of the agreements outlined above, its role is to facilitate inter- actions between all entities involved and assure interoperability between actors.', 'For example, Data Providers might have reason to propose their own license, especially to support values that are misrepresented in legal frameworks relevant to them 19.', 'In such cases, respecting our value of inclusivity and the local knowledge of the Providers on how best to represent their community’s in- terests means allowing them to use their own licensing in their interactions with Data Hosts rather then requiring them to use one designed by the DSO.', 'Conversely, some of the Data Providers,', 'Data 4 Black Lives, Our Data Bodies are two such organizations in the US.', 'Maori Data Sovereignty License', 'Data Governance in the Age of Large-Scale Data-Driven Language Technology', 'FAccT ’22, June 21–24, 2022, Seoul, Republic of Korea', 'DSO standard data license would foster inclusion.', 'We provide our proposal for such an agreement between the Data Hosts and Data Providers in Appendix B.', 'This tension reflects the governance trade-off between harmo- nization and independence mentioned in Section 2.1. One additional complexity of allowing Hosts and Providers to use custom licenses arises when a Host aggregates data from several Providers to share with a Data Modeler.', 'Without any categorization of the various Provider licenses, the Host would have to either develop a new custom license for each aggregation of data sources, or leave it to the Modeler to understand the interplay of the various constraints.', 'We address these issues through a dual approach.', 'First, the DSO provides a license template for use in exchanges between the Data Providers and Data Hosts.', 'Second, the DSO maintains a taxonomy of licenses designed to support rules for aggregating use case re- strictions from Providers for the agreement between the Hosts and Modelers, to be updated when a new license appears that is not easily categorized.20', 'This approach exemplifies the general role of the Data Steward- ship Organization at various points of exchange in the governance organization, in its two roles as a fallback mechanism or default option for actors that do not have the resources to develop their own processes, and as an enabler of interoperability between pro- cesses when they do: whether the process in question corresponds to the license agreement between the Data Host and Data Modelers, the framework for identifying a legitimate contestation request between a Data Host and Rights-holders, or the technical tools used for identifying personal information or managing access to data.', 'DISCUSSION We have introduced an approach to data governance, grounded in an ongoing year-long case study that coordinates data inter- nationally to train a Large Language Model.', 'Critical aspects of the governance structure include protocols for achieving differ- ent values, working with established norms, and contending with the different laws applicable across datasets.', 'This requires coor- dinating multiple stake-holders and rights-holders.', 'Our approach is modular, where different parties focus on different aspects of the dataset processing and sharing, interconnecting data providers, data hosts, and data developers.', 'This is coordinated by a Data Stew- ardship Organization that develops appropriate management plans, access restrictions, and legal scholarship.', 'A complementary Data Tooling efforts help to provide resources common to the legal and ethical needs of the participating institutions, We have found that one of the most difficult hurdles is developing legal agreements for Providers, Hosts, and Modelers that respect the laws and copyrights set forth in the data, as well as the laws of the institutions’ regions.', 'We tackle this problem through the lens of stated governance values, which inform the kinds of agreements that are necessary.', 'CLARIN (Section 4) uses a restricted version of such a taxonomy for non-commercial data only [76]', 'REFERENCES', 'REGULATION (EU) 2018/1725 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE

that we all had our own values, and our own goals and motivations in working on the project.', 'As such, we focused on identifying what values we were already bringing to the table.', 'This was an exercise of making the implicit explicit, and required annotating the initial planning documents alongside larger working group discussions.', 'First, we organized all documents and notes for the initial creation of BigScience and the working group in chronological order.', 'Then, the co-lead went through each, highlighting specifically mentioned values – such as geographical diversity – as well as annotating implicit values expressed in the text by the various authors and commenters.', 'For the latter approach, the terms used for the annotations served as placeholders for further discussion within the larger working group.', 'Then, the working group discussed the highlighted values and value annotations in light of their surrounding text, what the implicit ideas behind the text were, what we all felt we should be doing relevant to the value, and what we were all understanding and not understanding.', 'Throughout these discussions, we crafted definitions live for what these value terms meant.', 'Once the definitions were in place and generally agreed upon, we discussed the specific terms used as value labels, and in some cases changed them, or broke up definitions into different components to identify more than one value.', 'Screenshots representative of how these discussions evolved, in chronological order, are depicted in Figures 4, 5, 6, and 7', 'A.3 Growing Over the course of the project, the size of the working group grew.', 'From an initial set of around 10 people, we became a group of 50+ (some more involved than others), with some individuals taking on different roles as needs arose (for example, legal scholars and others interested worked on crafting a Data Host-Provider Agreement).', 'All participants were introduced to the grounding values and the overall plan for the governance structure as they joined;

mobilizing an organization to implement data governance remains elusive for practitioners.', 'On that account, this paper examines why governing data is difficult in local government organizations.', 'Based on a literature review and an empirical case study, we establish the inherent challenges and build on the notion of collective action to theorize the problem of data governance.', 'Following an engaged scholarship approach, we collect empirical material through six group interviews with 34 representatives from 13 different Danish municipalities.', 'We extend existing data governance research with our problem triangle that identifies and explicates the complex relations between six distinct challenges: value, collaboration, capabilities, overview, practices, and politics.', 'We demonstrate the value in theorizing data governance as a collective action problem and argue for the necessity of ensuring researchers and practitioners achieve a common understanding of the inherent challenges, as a first step towards developing data governance solutions that are viable in practice.', 'Keywords Data governance .', 'Collective action .', 'Local government .', 'Engaged scholarship',

(Dwivedi et al.', 'Pereira et al.', 'Yet, to benefit from data-driven opportunities, organizations must rethink the way they organize (Porter and Heppelmann 2014, 2015), because as the volume of data increases, the complexity of managing it does as well (Vilminko-Heikkinen et al.', 'This task can no longer be left to the traditional IT function (Lee et al.', 'Marchand and Peppard 2013).', 'Instead, the entire organization needs an over- arching direction for organizing, analyzing, and deploying an organization’s data assets (DalleMule and Davenport 2017).', 'To realize value from data, robust data governance is needed', 'Olivia Benfeldt obn@dps.aau.dk', 'John Stouby Persson john@cs.aau.dk', 'Sabine Madsen sam@dps.aau.dk', 'Aalborg University, Fibigerstræde 3, 9220 Aalborg, Denmark 2

goals by encouraging desirable behavior in the treatment of data as a resource.', 'Mobilizing an organization to adopt data governance has proven challenging in practice (Begg and Caira 2012; Ladley 2012; Vilminko-Heikkinen et al.', 'Taking stock of data inventory remains tedious (Kiron 2016), the value creating potential appears abstract (Begg and Caira 2012), and the importance of investing in data governance is understood only if a company has already suffered from major regulatory pres- sure or data breach (DalleMule and Davenport 2017).', 'Especially public-sector organizations, who routinely store large volumes of data (Klievink et al.', 'O.', 'B.', 'Nielsen et al.', 'Vilminko-Heikkinen et al.', 'Thompson et al.', 'Existing data governance literature is scarce on practical implementation, providing lit- tle actionable direction for organizations, and remains highly conceptual, with few studies engaged in theory development (Benfeldt Nielsen 2017).', 'Additionally, no studies report ex- plicitly on the particular challenges of governing data in public organizations (Vilminko-Heikkinen 2017).', 'Inf Syst Front (2020) 22:299–313', 'On that account, this paper considers data governance in the context of the local government level of the public sector in Denmark.', 'The public administration in Denmark was an early adopter of IT solutions (Rose et al.', 'Europe (European Commission 2017).', 'As an example, the current strategy for public digitalization in Denmark proposes a number of ambi- tious national goals for realizing value with data in public administration, including quicker case processing, increased economic growth, innovation, and balancing security and pri- vacy issues (Danish Ministry of Finance 2016).', 'However, due to the decentralized nature of the Danish public sector, local government organizations handle a diverse range of responsi- bilities, including primary education, day care for children, social welfare, care of the elderly, and many more (Local Government Denmark 2018).', 'As a result, a wealth of different systems has accumulated within and across these organiza- tions over the years and they are now faced with the complex task of collecting, storing and administering vast amounts of heterogeneous data; the volume and variety of which are only likely to increase (Agency for Digitisation 2018).', 'Governing public data has only become more complex with the instatement of a new European Union directive, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) valid from May 25, 2018 (European Union 2016).', 'The directive contains a series of principles that fundamentally reshapes the way data is handled by any organization with the specific intent to protect individ- ual rights to data privacy (European Commission 2018).', 'In order to balance ambitious strategy with practical, everyday complexities of data handling and the new GDPR, data gov- ernance becomes imperative, but as suggested by existing literature; an intricate challenge.', 'To examine the practicalities of introducing data governance into a complex, organizational reality, our research is motivated by the question Why is it difficult to mobilize local government organizations to engage in data governance?', 'To address this research question, we use a collaborative form of engaged scholarship (Van de Ven 2007) with specific emphasis on formulation of problems with (not for) practi- tioners (P.', 'A.', 'Nielsen and Persson 2016) and build on the notion of collective action problems (E.', 'Ostrom 2010; Torfing and Ansell 2016).', 'Collective action problems arise when Bindividuals take actions that maximizes short-term benefits to self [and] generate lower joint outcomes than could have been achieved^ (E.',

action theory to describe and explain why mobilizing organizations to adopt data governance is challenging.', 'First, we draw on existing data governance liter- ature to obtain a preliminary understanding of why regulating collective behavior related to data in an organizational context', 'We identify six data governance chal- lenges and theorize the relationship between them in a collec- tive action problem triangle.', 'Finally, we elaborate how our findings contribute to data governance literature and discuss implications for practice and suggestions for future research.', 'Data Governance', 'The lack of a widely accepted definition of data governance (Pierce et al.', 'Al-Ruithe et al.', 'Benfeldt Nielsen 2017; Brous et al.', 'One stream of research argues that data governance should func- tion as the means to resolve poor data quality, emerging from the field of data quality management (Alhassan et al.', 'Al-Ruithe et al.', 'Cheong and Chang 2007; Otto 2011a; Soares 2010; Weber et al.', 'While little attention is paid to what is actually meant by resolving poor quality, Otto mentions ensuring availability of specific data sets to remain compliant with regulatory or legal provisions, effective reporting, and integrated customer management (Otto 2011b).', 'Data governance is then supposed to help facilitate these, by Bsetting direction for the organization’s data quality manage- ment^ (Otto 2011b, p.', 'Although achieving better data quality is presented as unambiguous and objective (such as legislative compliance or effective reporting), Wang and Strong define data quality as Bdata that are fit for use by data consumers^ (Wang and Strong 1996, p.', 'Defining data governance in rela- tion to data quality ultimately involves deciding for what and by whom data is to be used, and then assigning accountabil- ities and rights accordingly.', 'Another stream takes its point of departure in Weill and Ross’ notion of IT governance (Weill and Ross 2004) by ar- guing that data governance should work to increase the value of data as organizational assets (Brous et al.', 'Coleman er al.', 'Khatri and Brown 2010; Pierce et al.', 'Thompson et al.', 'A premise of IT governance is to maximize the value organizations gain from IT, such that de- cisions regarding its development and use must be Baligned with organizational goals^ (Weill and Ross 2004, p.', 'For data governance, this means designing frameworks of decision-making domains and assigning accountability for de- cisions in these domains to specific roles in a way that relates to the organization’s overall goals (Khatri and Brown 2010).', 'The argument follows that if the treatment of data assets are aligned with the organization’s goals, the value of the assets increase (Ladley 2012).', 'Examples of such goals include effi- ciency improvement (e.g. integration, faster information de- livery), business contributors increase, (e.g. revenue, cus- tomers, market share), and reduction in risk (e.g. compliance, improved information privacy, improved data quality) (Ladley', 'Inf Syst Front (2020) 22:299–313', 'Defining data governance in relation to the value of data assets includes determining how data can be used to achieve broader organizational objectives and then assigning accountabilities and rights accordingly.', 'In this paper, we concur with the second stream (Khatri and Brown 2010; Ladley 2012).', 'We define data governance as the organization and implementation principles which outline and enforce who holds the decision rights and is held accountable for an organization’s data assets.', 'Embedded is the perception that data governance should contribute to organizational goals by encouraging desirable behavior in the treatment of data as an (organizational) resource.', 'We define data as physical signs that carry no inherent meaning, because they reside outside of human cognition, while information emerges, when meaning is attributed to data through cognitive processing by an actor (Baškarada and Koronios 2013; Beynon-Davies 2011).', 'Given these understandings of data and information, we tentatively place information systems as a collection of technology- supported processes that facilitate the use of information to (ideally) stimulate action in the social world (Mingers and Willcocks 2014).', 'An information system uses records to rep- resent, store, manipulate and transmit data (physical signs) to provide information and facilitate communication (meaning- ful signs) in support of human activity; information systems are not concerned with data, information, or technology as discrete entities, but rather how these are used to support pur- poseful action (Beynon-Davies 2009).', 'Data governance then regulates the part of an information system that concerns pro- duction and use of physical signs to affect purposeful action (in the social world), whatever it may be in a given organization.', 'While previous research has contributed valuable insights on how to design and conceive of data governance as an organization-wide program (Alhassan et al.', 'Brous et al.', 'Otto 2011a; 2011c; Weber et al.', 'Benfeldt Nielsen 2017).', 'Findings from peripheral do- mains suggest that data governance is in fact challenging.', 'First, two studies that examined data governance in Small to Medium sized Enterprises (SMEs) saw in both cases that practitioners had difficulty understanding why they should do data governance in the first place (Begg and Caira 2011, 2012).', 'Practitioners did not recognize the inherent value of their data nor did they view it as having independent existence from the systems that supported their business processes (Begg and Caira 2011).', 'Practitioners struggled to grasp the value-creating potential of data governance, perceiving the costs greater than the benefits, and as a result found it difficult to get started.', 'Additionally, Bthe language and terminology used by published data governance frameworks were not ap- propriate for […] those with minimal technical expertise^ (Begg and Caira 2012, p.', 'This leaves practitioners with', 'Bhas a major influence on an SME’s ability to develop a data governance strategy^ (p.', 'These findings underlines how practitioners find it difficult to understand the value of data and the value- creating potential of data governance (DalleMule and Davenport 2017; Kiron 2016).', 'Second, an aptly titled study BGovernment data does not mean data governance^ found that while public sector agen- cies may collect and store extensive volumes of data as part of their regulatory function, it does in no way mean they are well- equipped to handle it (Thompson et al.', 'In the case organization, officials had no confidence in the information used in a number of critical tasks, which ultimately affected the quality of the service provided to citizens.', 'The authors suggest that resolving this issue Bwould be directly influenced, improved, and monitored by a sound data governance initia- tive^ (Thompson et al.', 'Professionals with Bsound understanding of data management in all its facets (governance, development, security, or operations)^ (p.', 'Thus, a public organization may find it challeng- ing to acquire and possess the appropriate capabilities (skills and competences to enable action) to compose data gover- nance principles.', 'Third, Vilminko-Heikkinen et al.', 'Master data are^ those enti- ties, relationships, and attributes that are critical for an orga- nization and foundational to key business processes^ (Vilminko-Heikkinen et al.', 'Ladley 2012, p.', 'Management of master data may be placed as the responsibil- ity of a dedicated organizational function.', 'Establishing a data- related program across the entire organization was character- ized by tensions and conflicts, which resulted in downright paradoxes: Bsolutions that are both contradictory and interre- lated, such that any choice between them will only remain temporary and cause tension^ (Vilminko-Heikkinen et al.', 'Three paradoxes are particularly relevant.', 'First, there was a need to identify data owners, but people remained committed to group specific functions, and not to organization-wide development.', 'Second, although there was a recognized need for data governance, assigned tasks and responsibilities were avoided.', 'Third, there was an acknowl- edged need for an organization-wide vision of master data, yet individual views remained the order of the day.', 'These findings suggest that the mobilization of local government organiza- tions to engage in data governance will be affected by similar issues of collaboration.', 'Inf Syst Front (2020) 22:299–313', 'What emerges from existing literature on data governance in both private and public organizations is that mobilizing the organization remains complicated because the value of data governance is difficult to comprehend; organizational mem- bers remain committed to their individual or smaller group- specific functions; and appropriate capabilities to successfully engage with data governance are limited.', 'The complexity of governing data further increases in local governments, due to the sheer number of diverse responsibilities.', 'Such diversity necessarily results in a fragmented IT architecture that is re- sistant to extensive standardization (Agency for Digitisation 2018) and thus complicates the task of collecting, storing, and administering vast amounts of heterogenous data.', 'In addition, managing many, vastly different professional domains within one organization means managing a plethora of overall orga- nizational objectives, which makes it difficult to meaningfully conceive any high-level data governance principles that covers the entire organization.', 'To address these issues, we draw on the notion of collective action, which at its core the- orizes how various actors with heterogeneous interests and resources can work together to achieve a common goal.', 'Collective Action', 'There is no single theory of Bgovernance^ (Torfing 2012).', 'Rather, there are several, overlapping theoretical debates; dif- ferent analytical lenses through which to study governance and a tendency to add qualifiers, such as Bcorporate^, Bglobal^ or even Bdata^ to circumvent the issue (Torfing and Ansell 2016).', 'More often than not, these strategies result in an under- standing of governance that is too narrowly defined for sub- stantive analysis.', 'Therefore, we return to a broader literature on governance to theoretically explicate and expand the con- cept of governance in data governance.', 'In this paper, we adopt a generic understanding of governance as Bthe process of steering society and the economy through collective action and in accordance with common goals^ (Torfing 2012).', 'While an abundance of analytical approaches to study gover- nance exists, we choose to use a collective action theory lens (Holahan and Lubell 2016; E.', 'Ostrom 2010).', 'First, this aligns well with our generic understanding of governance defined above as the process of steering a group toward a common goal.', 'Second, we gleaned from previous research that data governance apparently involves issues when it comes to steering a collective to specific actions.', 'We are interested in eliciting why data governance is difficult, when we perceive it as a collective action problem, where a group of local govern- ment actors with heterogenous, potentially conflicting inter- ests is compelled to act towards a common, but also obfuscat- ed goal.', 'Early rational models of human behavior assumed collec- tive action would naturally occur in a group where individuals', 'Holahan and Lubell 2016).', 'Olson (1965) first challenged this proposition by conceiving the free- rider problem; any individual who benefit from a collective Bgood^ (resources or outcome) once it has been produced, will not voluntarily contribute to its production (Olson 1965; E.', 'Ostrom 1990).', 'Additionally, Hardin (1968) conceived The Tragedy of the Commons, which posits that individuals with access to a common pool of resources will continue to unsustainably exploit the resources, until the system collapses, unless governing measures are implemented by a coercive, central Bpower^ (Hardin 1968; Holahan and Lubell 2016; E.', 'Ostrom 1990).', 'These notions gave way to collective action problems; when individuals act to maximize short-term bene- fits to self, which in turn generate lower joint outcomes than could have been achieved for the whole, if they had cooperated (E.', 'Ostrom 2010).', 'A notable example of this is the prisoner’s dilemma, applied to noncooperative situations, where incentives are such that, by trying to maximize individ- ual benefits, each actor is worse off than all participants would have been if they had cooperated (Markus et al.', 'Within collective action theory, solving collective dilemmas requires regulating group member decisions through governance ar- rangements that effectively alter individual payoffs and result in a beneficial, joint outcome (Holahan and Lubell 2016).', 'Previous research in information systems (IS) has employed the collective action perspective (Constantinides and Barrett 2015; Markus et al.', 'Mindel et al.', 'Monge et al.', 'Unlike other types of collective goods, such as natural resources (forestry, water, land etc.), IS Bgoods^ are not discrete entities.', 'Rather, they consist of the interdependences, interests and resources of its distributed userbase; the good under scrutiny is not the IS itself, but the functionalities it affords as well as the willingness and capa- bilities of users to take advantage of these (Constantinides and Barrett 2015; Markus et al.', 'The quality of the good at any given time thus depends on the sustained contributions of these collective resources (Monge et al.', 'Mindel et al.', 'Building on Hardin’s idea of resource commons (Hardin 1968) and Ostrom’s idea of polycentricity (Ostrom 1972), they explain how to ensure long-term sustainability of open systems or Bcommons^ like Wikipedia and TripAdvisor, without a cen- tral authority to enact governance.', 'Here, heterogenous re- source contributions from many, different individuals are col- lectively regulated through a number of polycentric gover- nance practices, such as provider recognition, shared account- ability and boundary regulation (Mindel et al.', 'Their findings exemplify how governance of a collective should take into consideration the heterogeneity of resources contrib- uted by its members, since this impacts the overall quality of the Bgood^ produced.', 'Inf Syst Front (2020) 22:299–313', 'Markus et al.', 'They find that standards development may be characterized as the prisoner’s dilemma; no one has the incentive to contribute to the initial development of standards, because others who have not contributed cannot be excluded from using the stan- dard, once it has been implemented.', 'On the other hand, stan- dards diffusion is seen as the assurance game or Bstag hunt^, detailing the conflict between safety and social cooperation.', 'Two actors have the opportunity to hunt a stag or a hare; hares can be hunted alone, but are worth less than a stag, while choosing the stag will require individuals to cooperate to suc- ceed.', 'Each player must choose an action without knowing the choice of the other.', 'Because standards are only useful when they are generally adopted and potential adopters are uncertain about the costs, benefits, and risks of standards implementa- tion, each participant is motivated to delay adopting until con- vinced that others will also adopt (Markus et al.', 'Their findings illustrate how a collective action lens can reveal more c o m p l e x d y n a

study the development and governance of information infrastructures.', 'They examine how different ac- tors, such as users, developers and government employees frame a regional health information infrastructure as a Bgood^, what ideological positions underpin these frames and how they are sustained or challenged through relations of power and legitimacy.', 'From these findings, they propose a bottom- up, polycentric governance approach.', 'Here, governance is not defined centrally from the beginning, but rather progressively nested; stakeholder groups self-organize to the point it causes spillover effects on other group interests and only then is gov- ernance Bnested to a higher level^.', 'The authors propose grad- ually defining more detailed governance rules, while ensuring the diversity of framing and ideologies of the collective action are taken into account in a manner where all individuals with Bsubstantive interest^ are adequately represented (Constantinides and Barrett 2015, p.', 'Their findings em- phasize the importance of ideology and meaning within and between subgroups and how these, if not taken into account, will undermine centralized governance efforts of a large-scale information infrastructure; a perspective which contrasts how data governance literature tend to focus on defining an organization-wide approach (Khatri and Brown 2010; Otto 2011a).', 'By drawing parallels between existing literature on data governance and collective action in IS, we may now present our preliminary conception of why mobilizing an organization to adopt data governance is problematic, centering on three challenges (summarized in Table 1).', 'First, we consider how actors find it difficult to perceive the value of data governance', 'Table 1', 'Preliminary challenges', 'Challenge', 'Data governance', 'Collective action in IS', 'Perceiving', 'Actors struggle to', 'Participants attribute', 'Begg and Caira 2012)', 'Enabling', 'Actors remain committed to group-specific or individual functions rather than organization-wide development (Vilminko-Heikkinen et al.', 'Constantinides and Barrett 2015)', 'Participants compromise or obscure greater, collective outcomes to protect or realize individual, short-term interests (Markus et al.', 'Fostering', 'Actors are constrained by', 'Quality of good produced', 'Thompson et al.', 'Mindel et al.', 'Monge et al.', 'Second, we associate how actors remain committed to their individual functions rather than the organization-wide responsibilities with how participants in collective action will compromise joint outcomes to protect individual interests.', 'Last, we relate how actors are constrained by their capabilities in handling data to how the overall quality of a produced good depends on the heterogenous resources contributed by participants.', 'Research Approach', 'To empirically examine data governance as a collective action problem, we followed a collaborative form of engaged schol- arship (Elbanna et al.', 'Van de Ven 2007) with a particular focus on the formulation of problems with (not for) practi- tioners (P.', 'A.', 'Nielsen and Persson 2016).', 'We collaborated with participants in a Danish network for local government IT practitioners and researchers.', 'The network was founded in 2009 as part of a joint IS research project with a number of local government organizations, seeking to increase the de- gree of public digitalisation and municipalities’ ability to in- novate with IT (Rose et al.', 'In 2017, the network consisted of 13 local government organizations and a dozen IS researchers, who collaborate on a set number of workshops and theme days.', 'The participating members have previous experiences with engaging in academic IS scholarship, which helped the researchers gain access to the setting, create trust', 'Inf Syst Front (2020) 22:299–313', 'Fontana and Frey 1994; Harvey and Myers 1995).', 'Our point of departure for this study was the people working with data in local government and not the citizens’ perspective, unless the practitioners bring it up.', 'Research Setting', 'Denmark is a consensual and technologically advanced soci- ety.', 'In the Digital Economy and Society Index (2017) that summarizes indicators on Europe’s digital performance and competitiveness, Denmark holds the first place and is de- scribed as a world leader in digitization (European Commission 2017).', 'The national strategy for public digitali- zation through 2016–2020 (Danish Ministry of Finance 2016) aims to further enhance the use of IT in the public sector in order to deliver good, efficient, and coherent services to citi- zens and businesses.', 'More importantly, the strategy contains three highly ambitious goals that aim to incorporate data to enable better and quicker case processing, to exploit data as- sets as a driver for economic growth, and to protect citizens’ individual data privacy rights.', 'While interpreting the national digital strategy entails complexities of prioritization, it is high- ly influential on local government practice (Persson et al.', 'Danish government is somewhat decentralized, and local government organizations commission and manage their own data repositories in addition to the central registers.', 'They are not merely the executive wing of central government but have a great deal of autonomy in how their managers and elected officials choose to organize the delivery of public ser- vices.', 'Local government organizations are responsible for a large part of the Danish welfare state, such as primary educa- tion, day care for children, social welfare, and care of the elderly as important examples.', 'Historically, the governance of IT acquisition and develop- ment has been decentralized, focusing on highly specialized solutions to fit individual domain needs.', 'This has led to a current landscape of hundreds of different, fragmented sys- tems across departments (Agency for Digitisation 2018).', 'As a result, a single local government organization is tasked with storing, collecting, and administering vast amounts of hetero- geneous, and at times redundant, data across its many different systems.', 'Ensuring that these data are not only used to achieve strategic objectives but also managed responsibly has only become more urgent with the instatement of a new EU direc- tive, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (European Union 2016).', 'Valid from May 25, 2018, the direc- tive contains a series of principles that fundamentally reshapes the way data is handled by any organization in order to protect individual rights to data privacy (European Commission 2018).', 'A core difference from previous legislation on the topic of data protection is that organizations are now required to obtain explicit consent from users and in doing so, need to', 'As a tech- nologically advanced society, the Danish government pro- vides a wealth of digital public services, with the result that local government organizations inadvertently collect and store massive amounts of personally sensitive data on citizens, just to perform their duties.', 'Whether their role as a public institu- tion provides statutory basis for collecting these data or if there is a need to procure explicit consent from citizens is a funda- mental question that depends on the intended use, and as such a key issue to be addressed through data governance.', 'Data Collection and Analysis', 'The first author collected empirical data over a period of 4 months using semi-structured group interviews that has the advantages of being inexpensive, data rich, flexible, stimulat- ing to respondents, recall aiding, cumulative and elaborative, over and above individual responses (Fontana and Frey 1994).', 'Since the preliminary understanding of why governing data is difficult was gleaned from existing literature that did not nec- essarily focus explicitly on challenges, the semi-structured group interview allowed us to examine whether these were indeed viable challenges for practitioners, while still allowing participants to bring forth other key points.', 'The participants were members of the abovementioned network and came from several different layers of the local government organi- zations (in Danish termed Bmunicipalities^), ranging from managers, to consultants, project managers and technical ex- perts (see Appendix Table 4 for a list of participants).', 'The group interviews were used in this study to gain empirical data from several hierarchical levels in order to cover a Bvariety of voices^ (Myers and Newman 2007).', 'Municipalities differ across many characteristics, including size and digital maturi- ty.', 'Group interviews across (and among) practitioners in mu- nicipalities therefore allowed for nuances of practice to be brought forth, as the participants could discuss and reflect amongst themselves (Fontana and Frey 1994).', 'The data was collected through six sessions (see Table 2), with the first session on May 5, 2017 and the last on August 24, 2017, which was a year prior to GDPR was instated but without it figuring as a prominent issue in the sessions.', 'Two sessions were of a general character including participants from different municipalities, and three sessions involved par- ticipants from the same municipality.', 'One session only had one participant, and therefore functioned as a classic semi- structured interview (Myers and Newman 2007).', 'The first session introduced data governance as a viable practice (Khatri and Brown 2010) and we received feedback from practitioners regarding the necessity for and utility of such an approach in local government settings.', 'Between ses- sion #1 and #6, the first author conducted four interviews, which had the purpose of unfolding specific barriers, chal- lenges, or difficulties related to working with data.', 'As these', 'Inf

data governance going forward.', 'The collected data was coded by the first author following the conventional approach to qualitative content analysis (Hsieh and Shannon 2005).', 'First by reading transcripts and field notes, highlighting interesting or relevant parts, and collecting them in a separate document.', 'Upon completion, the extracted quotes were arranged as challenges and named.', 'The material was then coded again, using the newly constructed challenges to collapse any duplicates and reduce potential in- ternal contradictions.', 'The process was repeated until challenges could no longer be created, collapsed or split.', 'In order to reduce potential bias, the last general group session functioned as a site to test the validity of the identified challenges.', 'The last group session had the highest turn out, and thus allowed for valuable refinement of the findings from a variety of perspectives.', 'Findings', 'In this section, we present our findings, which comprise six challenges (see Table 3).', 'Challenges #1-#3 were conceived from the existing literature (c.f. Table 1), but further substan- tiated empirically.', 'Challenges #4-#6 emerged distinctly from the iterative coding of the empirical material.', 'Table 3 Six challenges with data governance', 'Challenge', 'Perceiving value', 'Enabling collaboration', 'Fostering capabilities Data overview', 'Local practices', 'Political ambience', 'Perceiving Value', 'Local government organizations struggle to perceive and ex- press the value-creating potential of data and data governance.', 'Short-term perspectives on usage and a poor understanding of what value data may create, when considered an organization- al asset, complicates the efforts to govern data.', 'A lack of understanding of what data can be used for beyond the context of its immediate practice either presents it as a by-product of working in a digital environment or binds its utility to performing a specific workflow: BMany of those who work with data are not used to thinking of data as an asset […] It’s usually very convenient if [they] can see a citizen in both systems because it’s updated...', 'Development consultant).', 'Another participant describes municipalities as ‘sober’, when it comes to collecting and using data, and frames it as a mindset that needs to be changed, rather than specific processes to be implemented: BA municipality is so- ber: it looks at what we can use data for right now.', 'We have to reverse the approach and acknowledge we have to collect [non-persona] data, even though we do not quite know what we need them for yet, and it’s a mental change of dimensions^ (Head of IT).', 'What needs to happen is a change of the mindset in going from a reactionary to a proactive view on data.', 'However, this will not happen by itself.', 'The employees have to be introduced to the somewhat abstract idea of seeing data as an asset: BPeople need to be told this story that you can see data as either something you depend on in being reactive, or where you consider it an asset [and] become a little more proactive^ (Development consultant).', 'Although participants show enthusiasm and see potential in working more structured with data, they find it challenging to express the potential value to stakeholders in the rest of the organization.', 'Especially framing the value of data initiatives to ensure economic resources for data related projects is diffi- cult: BOur BI (Business Intelligence) system has been three years on the way, and it has taken us long to convince our management to spend just minimal resources on this.', 'It’s hard', 'Collecting personal data without a consented purpose is illegal according to GDPR but local government organizations also have vast amounts of non- personal data.', 'Inf Syst Front (2020) 22:299–313', 'IT architect).', 'Some participants clearly perceive the benefits and poten- tial value of data initiatives, but find it challenging to commu- nicate to executive levels.', 'Others question the value, but hear from other local governments it is ‘the best thing’ to do: BWe find it hard to spot the value ourselves, but we know (…) that someone says it’s just the best thing you can do.', 'It’s also a good foundation [to invest in data governance] and our gut feeling tells us it’s a good idea, but we just want this specific use case that illustrates ‘this is what we’re going to create the foundation for’^ (Financial consultant).', 'What follows is an amalgamation of issues.', 'On one hand, local government practitioners attempt to secure resources to build an appropriate infrastructure for the future use of data, but lack a persuasive, illustrative use case to convince man- agement that investing in data as an asset is relevant.', 'Yet, these organizations find it difficult to perceive any long-term, value- creating opportunities with data, which could lead to the ‘good use case’, because local government employees remain nar- rowly focused on data in the context of day-to-day operations and welfare services.', 'As a result, the overarching goal remains too elusive, intangible, and even confusing for practitioners to mobilize the collective action of data governance.', 'Enabling Collaboration', 'Local government organizations struggle to foster cross- organizational collaboration between different, departmental functions, when it comes to treating data as an organizational asset.', 'If the different departments avoid cooperation, the or- ganizations cannot devise and implement effective data gov- ernance principles that actually enable valuable data sharing across.', 'One of the opportunities many local government orga- nizations are very keen to pursue, is combining all available data about a citizen from several systems across departments within one place.', 'The idea is to gain a ‘360 view of the indi- vidual’.', 'According to the participants, this will have transfor- mative impact on a wide variety of elements, from the way they monitor the effects of specific initiatives to the way they deliver public services to citizens.', 'Yet, to do so, the different departments have to establish tight collaboration with each other, but this is difficult: BYou can have a siloed organisation, and then work together across, with good processes.', 'But we don’t have that.', 'We try to facilitate data-sharing across [Departments] with a BI-project, but those are just the terms.', 'The departments simply don’t collaborate.^ (Financial consul- tant).', 'To enable data to flow across departments with these processes, organizational members have to change behavior to ensure data governance processes and principles are ad- hered to.', 'The wider the distance between what purpose a data governance process or principle serves and the person, who has to adhere to it, the less meaningful it might appear: BThe', 'Head of Digitalization).', 'As such, cross-organizational collaboration and deconstructing siloes become pivotal.', 'Yet, the collabora- tive work required may appear the least meaningful to the employees who are closest to the data, which in turn com- prises potential effort made and the joint greater outcome.', 'Fostering Capabilities', 'Inconsistent capabilities across departments and hierarchal levels make it difficult to envision an overall, strategic direc- tion for the use of data across a local government organization.', 'Data governance entails implementing processes and princi- ples that are supposed to be enterprise-wide.', 'However, it is not necessarily possible to design such an all-encompassing data governance program for a local government organization, be- cause the different departments have varying levels of data management maturity.', 'One important aspect of this maturity is the professional domain.', 'Several local government organi- zations point to the employment sector as very experienced in working with data: BThe field of employment is extremely data-driven and guided by managing information, which it has been for many years and I think it’s easy to notice how the employees have this experience and focus on data quality and data usage^ (Head of Digitalization).', 'On the other hand, the elderly sector is not experienced at all.', 'In one case, they lack basic understanding of IT for their profession: BWe have just reached out to the elder area, because we have to create a digitization strategy.', 'They do not have it in their conscious- ness, and we would like to help them.', 'The first meeting we had, they thought we were there to discuss which PCs they should have and what phones they should buy.', 'And that was probably the last thing we came to discuss^ (Head of IT).', 'The design and implementation of data governance for the organi- zation as a whole depends on the maturity of individual de- partments.', 'Departments’ professional experience and hetero- geneous resources, in either building new or developing existing data capabilities, impacts the quality of data gover- nance as the Bgood^ produced.', 'Data Overview', 'Local government organizations struggle to acquire an over- view of existing data sources.', 'While there is a desire to build appropriate data infrastructure, the current enterprise architec- ture is fragmented and fraught with legacy systems.', 'In many cases, organizations do not have access to some of their own data, as it is stored on servers placed with the vendors, who delivered the original system.', 'Often, these vendors demand high costs for providing access.', 'This contributes a problem, where it is expensive and complicated to gain an overview of', 'Inf Syst Front (2020) 22:299–313', 'BOne thing is the complexity of many different solutions, but it is something else to have 40 years of legacy systems that have been implemented at random.', 'There was no consideration of infrastructure at that time […] we are sitting on a gold mine of data and knowledge that we do not even know about^ (Head of IT).', 'At the forefront is a very concrete obstacle where any intent to make use of data assets is obstructed by the fact, they are downright difficult to access.', 'When no overview exists, it makes exploring potential value- generation for these assets complicated.', 'Without awareness of how data assets should contribute to organizational goals, con- ceiving data governance principles becomes impossible.', 'Local Practices', 'Diverse, local practices make it difficult for local government organizations to design and implement shared data gover- nance principles.', 'Individual departments are highly autono- mous in solving their local government responsibilities, which results in practices that are highly appropriate for the local tasks, but difficult to expand beyond the individual depart- ment.', 'To ensure that data treatment adheres to the principles set forth by the data governance program, some degree of standardization is necessary.', 'Enforcing standardized princi- ples for data treatment in highly specialized and autonomous departments is a central challenge; one which is also pointed to as a distinct feature of the public versus the private sector: BThis is the way you implement decisions, and it is very dif- ferent [from the private sector], because here, there is a lot of ro o m f o r i n t e r p re t a t i o n t h a t m a k e s t h i n g s l e s s straightforward^ (Head of IT).', 'Different departments usually implement a local adaption of a decision that fits their existing practice, rather than follow the standardized directions, an outcome likely to occur with data governance as well.', 'It is not only the practices that are diverse, but also relationships with existing IT professionals: BIdeally, it should be of value, but there is a big difference between speaking to a technical department full of engineers, or [speaking to] nurses, peda- gogues and teachers, because [then] you should really know your visiting hours and how to communicate^ (Development consultant).', 'As such, adopting data governance principles in departments that are used to and comfortable with working with data do not require the same effort as in departments, where exploiting data is not common practice.', 'Political Ambience', 'Mobilization of data governance is a political endeavor.', 'This either manifests as limited attention from politicians and top- level managers, or as skepticism and fear regarding data gov- ernance’s infringement upon existing autonomy.', 'Some partici- pants state that data governance should be on the political', 'To engage political support is a challenge, as there is no established linkage between improving public services and data: BNo politicians can comment on this meaningfully.', 'It is not a political issue in the municipality and when I say that, I mean something like ‘data is important be- cause it can make us a better municipality’ … But it’s not there, it’s only administrative^ (IT architect).', 'According to the partic- ipants, it is because they need the compelling use-case that shows how working structured and systematically with data translates to value in the local government context.', 'They agree that right now, most data initiatives are powered by passionate individuals: BThe passionate cannot drive this alone, because at one point there will be no more passion left.', 'There must be top management support^ (Project manager).', 'While this challenge relates to the difficulty of engaging the political agenda in data matters, achieving this type of top- level support also has other objectives and consequences.', 'Some professionals remain highly skeptical towards data gov- ernance and the role of data in their particular domain.', 'Especially departments within social fields remain distrustful, as their profession is about making individual, subjective judgements regarding sensitive cases: BHere …, it is more feeling for the individual case and [they are asking the ques- tion] what is it even data is.', 'Here, the anxiety [regarding data] is more pronounced^ (Financial consultant).', 'Some profes- sionals see data governance and the increased focus on data- driven decision-making lead to an unwanted scrutiny of their cases.', 'They fear exposure of their work to other parts of the organization, which may result in someone higher up making decisions regarding their domain, based on this data, without consulting them.', 'A fear that others might downright misinter- pret data is apparent: BPeople fear you interpret the data in- correctly, so just trusting that data is being treated and ana- lyzed correctly is a huge change-oriented project in itself^ (Financial consultant).', 'Specialists do not trust that data will be used appropriately or adequately, and therefore remain skeptical about following data governance principles.', 'Consequently, attempting to govern data assets in a local government context is a politically infused endeavor, in that it may either bring great improvements or disturb some funda- mental values.', 'Bringing data usage on the political agenda is thus both an issue of enabling data opportunities and raising awareness regarding its applicability in the public sector, but also constrained by the idea that powerful interests may influ- ence its strategic direction.', 'Discussion', 'In this section, we summarize our research findings into a Bproblem triangle^ (see Fig.', 'Fig.', 'The problem triangle of data governance', 'Inf Syst Front (2020) 22:299–313', 'We consider how results from this study contribute to existing research and we deliberate the findings’ implications for practice and point to directions for future research.', 'The Problem Triangle', 'So far, we have focused on identifying and describing the distinct challenges of data governance.', 'In this section, we submit that these six constituent challenges contribute in mu- tually reinforcing ways to form a problem triangle as illustrat- ed in Fig.', 'The problem triangle demonstrates that mobilizing an or- ganization to engage in data governance is difficult, not only as a result of the individual challenges, but also because these are interdependent and only adequately addressed together.', 'Consequently, we theorize the relationship between chal- lenges #1–3 through their interdependencies with challenges #4–6, as the first three cannot be resolved in isolation, without considering the last three:', 'Perceiving value (#1) requires a fertile political ambience (#6) to position data governance initiatives as desirable within the organizational context, but also an appropriate overview (#4) of which data sources exist to determine their value-creating potential.', 'Enabling collaboration (#2) requires for diverging, local practices (#5) across collaborating functions to make mu- tual adjustments, but also that political ambience (#6) offer', 'Fostering capabilities (#3) requires a suitable overview (#4) of what specific types of data resources to account for, while paying attention to how various local practices (#5) currently foster certain specific capabilities.', 'In parallel, challenges #1–3 in some way also reinforce challenges #4–6, indicating that the last three cannot be inde- pendently addressed because they are constituted by the first three:', 'Data overview (#4) remains inadequate due to a lack of the right capabilities (#3) across departments to actually establish an accurate overview and further exacerbated by fundamental difficulties in perceiving the value (#1) of having such an overview of data assets.', 'Local practices (#5) remain difficult to consolidate due to lack of cross-functional collaboration (#2) on data initia- tives and further restrained by the varying maturities of data capabilities (#3) across the collaborating functions.', 'Political ambience (#6) remains influenced by the limited ability to perceive the value (#1) of data as meaningful and enabling in a political context and further affected by the lack of cross-functional collaboration (#3) needed to envi- sion the potential of using data to transform public services.', 'We suggest that the problem triangle, with the delineated relationships between the six challenges, represents data', 'Inf Syst Front (2020) 22:299–313', 'Perceiving value of data governance is challenging be- cause actors in a collective tend to ascribe different mean- ings to the purpose or outcome of the collective action.', 'Enabling collaboration between functions on data gover- nance is complicated because actors tend to take actions that protect their individual interests at the expense of achieving a greater joint outcome.', 'Fostering capabilities for governing data is difficult be- cause doing so requires effectively managing heteroge- neous resources contributed by different actors to the com- mon Bgood^ produced in a collective.', 'When we adopt a collective action lens to consider the governance aspect of data governance, it brings underlying issues, such as data overview, local practices and political ambience to the forefront.', 'Recognizing data governance as a collective action problem rather than an exercise in assigning accountabilities also encourages markedly different avenues for improvement.', 'Solving such dilemmas often requires alter- ing payoffs through governance arrangements to realign indi- vidual decisions that together result in the desired joint out- come (Torfing and Ansell 2016).', 'Contribution to Existing Research', 'Previous research offers valuable input on how to design and conceive of data governance as an organization-wide program (Alhassan et al.', 'Brous et al.', 'Otto 2011a; 2011c; Weber et al.', 'Our research contributes to the data governance literature with a theory-informed empirical account of the intricacies involved in mobilizing an organiza- tion to engage in data governance.', 'This reveals a complexity that go well beyond existing, seminal work within the field (Begg and Caira 2012; Thompson et al.', 'Vilminko- Heikkinen et al.', 'On the other hand, our findings also resonate with research on broader issues in e-government and indicate that data governance is difficult, because the inherent challenges are tied to the core of what it means to do public administration in a digital society.', 'More impor- the similarities between our challenges and tantly, known e-government issues, such as competing value positions (Rose et al.', 'Juell-Skielse et al.', 'Kim and Grant 2010), demonstrate the utility in perceiving data governance in local', 'Elaborately designed data governance policies are likely to fall short, when introduced into complex, organiza- tional realities, if data governance research continues to retain its narrow focus on how to define principles and assign accountabilities, without considering how value, capabilities, collaboration, overview, practices, and poli- tics factor in and constitute an interrelated problem.', 'Implications and Suggestions for Future Research', 'In the words of American, pragmatist philosopher John Dewey, B…a problem well put is half solved.', 'To mis- take the problem involved is to cause subsequent inqui- ry to be irrelevant.', 'Without a problem, there is blind groping in the dark^ (Dewey 1938, p.', 'The prevail- ing lack of a common direction of inquiry (Al-Ruithe et al.', 'Benfeldt Nielsen 2017; Brous et al.', 'Yet, if formulation of research problems is taken for granted or not made explicit, it is likely that essential characteristics remain overlooked, resulting in inadequate or misdirected solu- tions (Volkema 1995).', 'As such, previous IS literature have argued for the particular advantage of formulating f o r ) p r a c t i t i o n e r s r e s e a r c h pr ob l e m s w i t h ( n o t (Mathiassen 2002; P.', 'A.', 'Nielsen and Persson 2016).', 'While engagement with practice by scholars is neces- sary because most real world problems are too complex to be captured by any one perspective (Van de Ven 2007, p.', 'Defining them therefore necessarily requires deliberate framing with relevant stakeholders.', 'By engaging with practitioners in deter- mining why governing data is difficult, this paper has several implications, both for practice and future research.', 'Our findings demonstrate that data governance in lo- that re- cal government quires more than just the designation of roles and re- sponsibilities.', 'Data governance requires attention to a complex, organizational reality, where six intricate chal- lenges form a collective action problem and implicate even broader issues, known in existing e-government literature.', 'In previous research, Bparadoxes^ (Vilminko- Heikkinen et al.', 'Bwill only remain temporary and cause tension^ (p.', 'Although we argue data gover- nance is a collective action problem, our conception of Bchallenges^ constitutes a more useful frame for local government practitioners by breaking the grander prob- lem down into manageable issues.', 'The notion of', 'Inf Syst Front (2020) 22:299–313', 'In any case, creative, breakthrough ideas often come from spending time understanding the problem and exploring its boundaries (Volkema 1995).', 'While practitioners are keen to pursue data related opportunities, they struggle with mobilizing their entire organization to adopt data governance, according to the findings of this study.', 'The heterogeneity and lack of collaboration between subgroups in the form of depart- ments and professional domains pose a great challenge to a fundamental tenet of data governance, namely that it should be approached from the top-down as an orga- nization wide approach (Begg and Caira 2012; Vilminko-Heikkinen et al.', 'Here, the analytical value of employing a collective action perspective on data governance also emerges.', 'Previous research has focused on isolated aspects, such as determining general principles (Brous et al.', 'Alhassan et al.', 'Our study suggests that mobilizing an organization to actually adhere to these aspects is a matter of en- abling collective action between heterogeneous actors with different motivations and resources.', 'A central im- plication for practice is thus to address the significant governance challenge, which consists of realigning these individual interests to achieve a greater joint outcome.', 'Returning to Constantinides and Barrett’s study on governing information infrastructures (Constantinides they propose Bprogressive nesting^ and Barrett 2015), as a solution.', 'Here, governance is not initially defined from a centralized, top-down perspective as proposed in some data governance approaches (Khatri and Brown 2010), but rather progressively nested.', 'For example, groups of local government actors self-organize on prin- ciples regarding their own data assets, but as soon as it leads to spill over into other domains, an overarching principle must be established.', 'As such, data governance is Bnested to a higher level^.', 'Practitioners can employ this bottom-up process to progressively define more de- tailed governance rules, which may eventually cover the entire organization, while to a large extent still accom- modating the heterogeneity of individual departmental responsibilities.', 'If engaging in IS research is viewed as a problem- solving process, where any theory developed or solution conceived is directly predicated on the nature of the research problem (Gregor 2006), there is significant val- ue in theorizing an IS problem with practitioners before', 'Van de Ven 2007).', 'Our proposition that data governance may be understood as a collective action problem thus opens up a plethora of new avenues for IS research on the topic of data governance.', 'We propose that future research delves into mitigating the constituent issues of the problem triangle (Fig.', 'Also, studies that explore how to achieve aforemen- tioned form of bottom-up governance for data assets as a way to address the challenges are encouraged.', 'Understanding value in the context of governing data appears to be a particularly wicked and pervasive chal- lenge, where studies that specifically examine how to define and convey data value could benefit both practi- tioners and researchers.', 'Finally, we must emphasize that our investigation of chal- lenges with data governance is limited to the views within local government organizations.', 'Involving citizens is a very important direction for future data governance research, and also a well-known problem in the e-government literature (Medaglia 2012; Medaglia et al.', 'Olphert and Damodaran 2007; Rose et al.', 'With the instatement of GDPR, where individual data privacy rights move to the forefront, engaging citizens to determine how to best govern sensitive, personal data will only become more important (Winter and Davidson 2018).', 'We urge data governance re- searchers to explore this avenue in further detail.', 'Conclusion', 'Data governance research has focused on isolated aspects, with little attention paid to how practitioners introduce data governance into a complex, organizational reality.', 'Our inves- tigation of Danish local government contributes fresh insights into why governing data is difficult, namely due to six inter- related challenges: perceiving value, enabling collaboration, fostering capabilities, data overview, local practices and polit- ical ambience.', 'We explicate the relationship between these challenges in a problem triangle and demonstrate both theo- retical and practical implications of viewing data governance as a collective action problem, where local government actors with heterogenous, potentially conflicting, interests struggle to find value in and act together towards a common goal.', 'We suggest our problem triangle may assist practitioners in local government organizations to better understand the com- plexity they face, when attempting to mobilize their organiza- tions and formally govern their data assets.', 'Moreover, our findings can inspire researchers to study data governance be- yond large-scale, company-wide programs that primarily fo- cus on the assignment of accountabilities.', 'Inf Syst Front (2020) 22:299–313', 'Appendix 1', 'Table 4 Note: This data is mandatory.', 'Please provide', 'Municipality', 'Title', 'Workshop 1', 'A A A A A A Z', 'Y B B B B B

has clear benefits, mobilizing an organization to implement data governance remains elusive for practitioners.', 'On that account, this paper examines why governing data is difficult in local

governance.', 'Following an engaged scholarship approach, we collect empirical material through six group interviews with 34 representatives from 13 different Danish municipalities.', 'We extend

early adopter of IT solutions (Rose et al.', 'Europe (European Commission 2017).', 'As an example, the current strategy for public digitalization in Denmark proposes a number of ambi- tious national goals for realizing value with data in public administration, including quicker case processing, increased economic growth, innovation, and balancing security and pri- vacy issues (Danish Ministry of Finance 2016).', 'However, due to the decentralized nature of the Danish public sector, local government organizations handle a diverse range of responsi- bilities, including primary education, day care for children, social welfare, care of the elderly, and many more (Local Government Denmark 2018).', 'As a result, a wealth of different systems has accumulated within and across these organiza- tions over the years and they are now faced with the complex task of collecting, storing and administering vast amounts of heterogeneous data; the volume and variety of which are only likely to increase (Agency for Digitisation 2018).', 'Governing public data has only become more complex with the instatement of a new European Union directive, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) valid from May 25, 2018 (European Union 2016).', 'The directive contains a series of principles that fundamentally reshapes the way data is handled by any organization with the specific intent to protect individ- ual rights to data privacy (European Commission 2018).', 'In order to balance ambitious strategy with practical, everyday complexities of data handling and the new GDPR, data gov- ernance becomes imperative, but as suggested by existing literature; an intricate challenge.', 'To examine the practicalities of introducing data governance into a complex, organizational reality, our research is motivated by the question Why is it difficult to mobilize local government organizations to engage in data governance?', 'To address this research question, we use a collaborative form of engaged scholarship (Van de Ven 2007) with specific emphasis on formulation of problems with (not for) practi- tioners (P.', 'A.', 'Nielsen and Persson 2016) and build on the notion of collective action problems (E.', 'Ostrom 2010; Torfing and Ansell 2016).', 'Collective action problems arise when Bindividuals take actions that maximizes short-term benefits to self [and] generate lower joint

suggestions for future research.', 'Data Governance', 'The lack of a widely accepted definition of data governance (Pierce et al.', 'Al-Ruithe et al.', 'Benfeldt Nielsen 2017; Brous et al.', 'One stream of research argues that data governance should func- tion as the means to resolve poor data quality, emerging from the field of data quality management (Alhassan et al.', 'Al-Ruithe et al.', 'Cheong and Chang 2007; Otto 2011a; Soares 2010; Weber et al.', 'While little attention is paid to what is actually meant by resolving poor quality, Otto mentions ensuring availability of specific data sets to remain compliant with regulatory or legal provisions, effective reporting, and integrated customer management (Otto 2011b).', 'Data governance is then supposed to help facilitate these, by Bsetting direction for the organization’s data quality manage- ment^ (Otto 2011b, p.', 'Although achieving better data quality is presented as unambiguous and objective (such as legislative compliance or effective reporting), Wang and Strong define data quality as Bdata that are fit for use by data consumers^ (Wang and Strong 1996, p.', 'Defining data governance in rela- tion to data quality ultimately involves deciding for what and by whom data is to be used, and then assigning accountabil- ities and rights accordingly.', 'Another stream takes its point of departure in Weill and Ross’ notion of IT governance (Weill and Ross 2004) by ar- guing that data governance should work to increase the value of data as organizational assets (Brous et al.', 'Coleman er al.', 'Khatri and Brown 2010; Pierce et al.', 'Thompson et al.', 'A premise of IT governance is to maximize the value organizations gain from IT, such that de- cisions regarding its development and use must be Baligned with organizational goals^ (Weill and Ross 2004, p.', 'For data governance, this means designing frameworks of decision-making domains and assigning accountability for de- cisions in these domains to specific roles in a way that relates to the organization’s overall goals (Khatri and Brown 2010).', 'The argument follows that if the treatment of data assets are aligned with the organization’s goals, the value of the assets increase (Ladley 2012).', 'Examples of such goals include effi- ciency improvement (e.g. integration, faster information de- livery), business contributors increase, (e.g. revenue, cus- tomers, market share), and reduction in risk (e.g. compliance, improved information privacy, improved data quality) (Ladley', 'Inf Syst Front (2020) 22:299–313', 'Defining data governance in relation to the value of data assets includes determining how data can be used to achieve broader organizational objectives and then assigning accountabilities and rights accordingly.', 'In this paper, we concur with the second stream (Khatri and Brown 2010; Ladley 2012).', 'We define data governance as the organization and implementation principles which outline and enforce who holds the decision rights and is held accountable for an organization’s data assets.', 'Embedded is the perception that data governance should contribute to organizational goals by encouraging desirable behavior in the treatment of data as an (organizational) resource.', 'We define data as physical signs that carry no inherent meaning, because they reside outside of human cognition, while information emerges, when meaning is attributed to data through cognitive processing by an actor (Baškarada and Koronios 2013; Beynon-Davies 2011).', 'Given these understandings of data and information, we tentatively place information systems as a collection of technology- supported processes that facilitate the use of information to (ideally) stimulate action in the social world (Mingers and Willcocks 2014).', 'An information system uses records to rep- resent, store, manipulate and transmit data (physical signs) to provide information and facilitate communication (meaning- ful signs) in support of human activity; information systems are not concerned with data, information, or technology as discrete entities, but rather how these are used to support pur- poseful action (Beynon-Davies 2009).', 'Data governance then regulates the part of an information system that concerns pro- duction and use of physical signs to affect purposeful action (in the social world), whatever it may be in a given organization.', 'While previous research has contributed valuable insights on how to design and conceive of data governance as an organization-wide program (Alhassan et al.', 'Brous et al.', 'Otto 2011a; 2011c; Weber et al.', 'Benfeldt Nielsen 2017).', 'Findings from peripheral do- mains suggest that data governance is in fact challenging.', 'First, two studies that examined data governance in Small to Medium sized Enterprises (SMEs) saw in both cases that practitioners had difficulty understanding why they should do data governance in the first place (Begg and Caira 2011, 2012).', 'Practitioners did not recognize the inherent value of their data nor did they view it as having independent existence from the systems that supported their business processes (Begg and Caira 2011).', 'Practitioners struggled to grasp the value-creating potential of data governance, perceiving the costs greater than the benefits, and as a result found it difficult to get started.', 'Additionally, Bthe language and terminology used by published data governance frameworks were not ap- propriate for […] those with minimal technical expertise^ (Begg and Caira 2012, p.', 'This leaves practitioners with', 'Bhas a major influence on an SME’s ability to develop a data governance strategy^ (p.', 'These findings underlines how practitioners find it difficult to understand the value of data and the value- creating potential of data governance (DalleMule and Davenport 2017; Kiron 2016).', 'Second, an aptly titled study BGovernment data does not mean data governance^ found that while public sector agen- cies may collect and store extensive volumes of data as part of their regulatory function, it does in no way mean they are well- equipped to handle it (Thompson et al.', 'In the case organization, officials had no confidence in the information used in a number of critical tasks, which ultimately affected the quality of the service provided to citizens.', 'The authors suggest that resolving this issue Bwould be directly influenced, improved, and monitored by a sound data governance initia- tive^ (Thompson et al.', 'Professionals with Bsound understanding of data management in all its facets (governance, development, security, or operations)^ (p.', 'Thus, a public organization may find it challeng- ing to acquire and possess the appropriate capabilities (skills and competences to enable action) to compose data gover- nance principles.', 'Third, Vilminko-Heikkinen et al.', 'Master data are^ those enti- ties, relationships, and attributes that are critical for an orga- nization and foundational to key business processes^ (Vilminko-Heikkinen et al.', 'Ladley 2012, p.', 'Management of master data may be placed as the responsibil- ity of a dedicated organizational function.', 'Establishing a data- related program across the entire organization was character- ized by tensions and conflicts, which resulted in downright paradoxes: Bsolutions that are both contradictory and interre- lated, such that any choice between them will only remain temporary and cause tension^ (Vilminko-Heikkinen et al.', 'Three paradoxes are particularly relevant.', 'First, there was a need to identify data owners, but people remained committed to group specific functions, and not to organization-wide development.', 'Second, although there was a recognized need for data governance, assigned tasks and responsibilities were avoided.', 'Third, there was an acknowl- edged need for an organization-wide vision of master data, yet individual views remained the order of the day.', 'These findings suggest that the mobilization of local government organiza- tions to engage in data governance will be affected by similar issues of collaboration.', 'Inf Syst Front (2020) 22:299–313', 'What emerges from existing literature on data governance in both private and public organizations is that mobilizing the organization remains complicated because the value of data governance is difficult to comprehend; organizational mem- bers remain committed to their individual or smaller group- specific functions; and appropriate capabilities to successfully engage with data governance are limited.', 'The complexity of governing data further increases in local governments, due to the sheer number of diverse responsibilities.', 'Such diversity necessarily results in a fragmented IT architecture that is re- sistant to extensive standardization (Agency for Digitisation 2018) and thus complicates the task of collecting, storing, and administering vast amounts of heterogenous data.', 'In addition, managing many, vastly different professional domains within one organization means managing a plethora of overall orga- nizational objectives, which makes it difficult to meaningfully conceive any high-level data governance principles that covers the entire organization.', 'To address these issues, we draw on the notion of collective action, which at its core the- orizes how various actors with heterogeneous interests and resources can work together to achieve a common goal.', 'Collective Action', 'There is no single theory of Bgovernance^ (Torfing 2012).', 'Rather, there are several, overlapping theoretical debates; dif- ferent analytical lenses through which to study governance and a tendency to add qualifiers, such as Bcorporate^, Bglobal^ or even Bdata^ to circumvent the issue (Torfing and Ansell 2016).', 'More often than not, these strategies result in an under- standing of governance that is too narrowly defined for sub- stantive analysis.', 'Therefore, we return to a broader literature on governance to theoretically explicate and expand the con- cept of governance in data governance.', 'In this paper, we adopt a generic understanding of governance as Bthe process of steering society and the economy through collective action and in accordance with common goals^ (Torfing 2012).', 'While an abundance of analytical approaches to study gover- nance exists, we choose to use a collective action theory lens (Holahan and Lubell 2016; E.', 'Ostrom 2010).', 'First, this aligns well with our generic understanding of governance defined above as the process of steering a group toward a common goal.', 'Second, we gleaned from previous research that data governance apparently involves issues when it comes to steering a collective to specific actions.', 'We are interested in eliciting why data governance is difficult, when we perceive it as a collective action problem, where a group of local govern- ment actors with heterogenous, potentially conflicting inter- ests is compelled to act towards a common, but also obfuscat- ed goal.', 'Early rational models of human behavior assumed collec- tive action would naturally occur in a group where individuals', 'Holahan and Lubell 2016).', 'Olson (1965) first challenged this proposition by conceiving the free- rider problem; any individual who benefit from a collective Bgood^ (resources or outcome) once it has been produced, will not voluntarily contribute to its production (Olson 1965; E.', 'Ostrom 1990).', 'Additionally, Hardin (1968) conceived The Tragedy of the Commons, which posits that individuals with access to a common pool of resources will continue to unsustainably exploit the resources, until the system collapses, unless governing measures are implemented by a coercive, central Bpower^ (Hardin 1968; Holahan and Lubell 2016; E.', 'Ostrom 1990).', 'These notions gave way to collective action problems; when individuals act to maximize short-term bene- fits to self, which in turn generate lower joint outcomes than could have been achieved for the whole, if they had cooperated (E.', 'Ostrom 2010).', 'A notable example of this is the prisoner’s dilemma, applied to noncooperative situations, where incentives are such that, by trying to maximize individ- ual benefits, each actor is worse off than all participants would have been if they had cooperated (Markus et al.', 'Within collective action theory, solving collective dilemmas requires regulating group member decisions through governance ar- rangements that effectively alter individual payoffs and result in a beneficial, joint outcome (Holahan and Lubell 2016).', 'Previous research in information systems (IS) has employed the collective action perspective (Constantinides and Barrett 2015; Markus et al.', 'Mindel et al.', 'Monge et al.', 'Unlike other types of collective goods, such as natural resources (forestry, water, land etc.), IS Bgoods^ are not discrete entities.', 'Rather, they consist of the interdependences, interests and resources of its distributed userbase; the good under scrutiny is not the IS itself, but the functionalities it affords as well as the willingness and capa- bilities of users to take advantage of these (Constantinides and Barrett 2015; Markus et al.', 'The quality of the good at any given time thus depends on the sustained contributions of these collective resources (Monge et al.', 'Mindel et al.', 'Building on Hardin’s idea of resource commons (Hardin 1968) and Ostrom’s idea of polycentricity (Ostrom 1972), they explain how to ensure long-term sustainability of open systems or Bcommons^ like Wikipedia and TripAdvisor, without a cen- tral authority to enact governance.', 'Here, heterogenous re- source contributions from many, different individuals are col- lectively regulated through a number of polycentric gover- nance practices, such as provider recognition, shared account- ability and boundary regulation (Mindel et al.', 'Their findings exemplify how governance of a collective should take into consideration the heterogeneity of resources contrib- uted by its members, since this impacts the overall quality of the Bgood^ produced.', 'Inf Syst Front (2020) 22:299–313', 'Markus et al.', 'They find that standards development may be characterized as the prisoner’s dilemma; no one has the incentive to contribute to the initial development of standards, because others who have not contributed cannot be excluded from using the stan- dard, once it has been implemented.', 'On the other hand, stan- dards diffusion is seen as the assurance game or Bstag hunt^, detailing the conflict between safety and social cooperation.', 'Two actors have the opportunity to hunt a stag or a hare; hares can be hunted alone, but are worth less than a stag, while choosing the stag will require individuals to cooperate to suc- ceed.', 'Each player must choose an action without knowing the choice of the other.', 'Because standards are only useful when they are generally adopted and potential adopters are uncertain about the costs, benefits, and risks of standards implementa- tion, each participant is motivated to delay adopting until con- vinced that others will also adopt (Markus et al.', 'Their findings illustrate how a collective action lens can reveal more c o m p l e x d y n a m i c s b e h i n d t h e ( i r ) r a t i o n a l e a n d (un)willingness of actors to collaborate on IS development.', 'Constantinides and Barrett (2015) build on this notion of collective action to study the development and governance of information infrastructures.', 'They examine how different ac- tors, such as users, developers and government employees frame a regional health information infrastructure as a Bgood^, what ideological positions underpin these frames and how they are sustained or challenged through relations of power and legitimacy.', 'From these findings, they propose a bottom- up, polycentric governance approach.', 'Here, governance is not defined centrally from the beginning, but rather progressively nested; stakeholder groups self-organize to the point it causes spillover effects on other group interests and only then is gov- ernance Bnested to a higher level^.', 'The authors propose grad- ually defining more detailed governance rules, while ensuring the diversity of framing and ideologies of the collective action are taken into account in a manner where all individuals with Bsubstantive interest^ are adequately represented (Constantinides and Barrett 2015, p.', 'Their findings em- phasize the importance of ideology and meaning within and between subgroups and how these, if not taken into account, will undermine centralized governance efforts of a large-scale information infrastructure; a perspective which contrasts how data governance literature tend to focus on defining an organization-wide approach (Khatri and Brown 2010; Otto 2011a).', 'By drawing parallels between existing literature on data governance and collective action in IS, we may now present our preliminary conception of why mobilizing an organization to adopt data governance is problematic, centering on three challenges (summarized in Table 1).', 'First, we consider how actors find it difficult to perceive the value of data governance', 'Table 1', 'Preliminary challenges', 'Challenge', 'Data governance', 'Collective action in IS', 'Perceiving', 'Actors struggle to', 'Participants attribute', 'Begg and Caira 2012)', 'Enabling', 'Actors remain committed to group-specific or individual functions rather than organization-wide development (Vilminko-Heikkinen et al.', 'Constantinides and Barrett 2015)', 'Participants compromise or obscure greater, collective outcomes to protect or realize individual, short-term interests (Markus et al.', 'Fostering', 'Actors are constrained by', 'Quality of good produced', 'Thompson et al.', 'Mindel et al.', 'Monge et al.', 'Second, we associate how actors remain committed to their individual functions rather than the organization-wide responsibilities with how participants in collective action will compromise joint outcomes to protect individual interests.', 'Last, we relate how actors are constrained by their capabilities in handling data to how the overall quality of a produced good depends on the heterogenous resources contributed by participants.', 'Research Approach', 'To empirically examine data governance as a collective action problem, we followed a collaborative form of engaged schol- arship (Elbanna et al.', 'Van de Ven 2007) with a particular focus on the formulation of problems with (not for) practi- tioners (P.', 'A.', 'Nielsen and Persson 2016).', 'We collaborated with participants in a Danish network for local government IT practitioners and researchers.', 'The network was founded in 2009 as part of a joint IS research project with a number of local government organizations, seeking to increase the de- gree of public digitalisation and municipalities’ ability to in- novate with IT (Rose et al.', 'In 2017, the network consisted of 13 local government organizations and a dozen IS researchers, who collaborate on a set number of workshops and theme days.', 'The participating members have previous experiences with engaging in academic IS scholarship, which helped the researchers gain access to the setting, create trust', 'Inf Syst Front (2020) 22:299–313', 'Fontana and Frey 1994; Harvey and Myers 1995).', 'Our point of departure for this study was the people working with data in local government and not the citizens’ perspective, unless the practitioners bring it up.', 'Research Setting', 'Denmark is a consensual and technologically advanced soci- ety.', 'In the Digital Economy and Society Index (2017) that summarizes indicators on Europe’s digital performance and competitiveness, Denmark holds the first place and is de- scribed as a world leader in digitization (European Commission 2017).', 'The national strategy for public digitali- zation through 2016–2020 (Danish Ministry of Finance 2016) aims to further enhance the use of IT in the public sector in order to deliver good, efficient, and coherent services to citi- zens and businesses.', 'More importantly, the strategy contains three highly ambitious goals that aim to incorporate data to enable better and quicker case processing, to exploit data as- sets as a driver for economic growth, and to protect citizens’ individual data privacy rights.', 'While interpreting the national digital strategy entails complexities of prioritization, it is high- ly influential on local government practice (Persson et al.', 'Danish government is somewhat decentralized, and local government organizations commission and manage their own data repositories in addition to the central registers.', 'They are not merely the executive wing of central government but have a great deal of autonomy in how their managers and elected officials choose to organize the delivery of public ser- vices.', 'Local government organizations are responsible for a large part of the Danish welfare state, such as primary educa- tion, day care for children, social welfare, and care of the elderly as important examples.', 'Historically, the governance of IT acquisition and develop- ment has been decentralized, focusing on highly specialized solutions to fit individual domain needs.', 'This has led to a current landscape of hundreds of different, fragmented sys- tems across departments (Agency for Digitisation 2018).', 'As a result, a single local government organization is tasked with storing, collecting, and administering vast amounts of hetero- geneous, and at times redundant, data across its many different systems.', 'Ensuring that these data are not only used to achieve strategic objectives but also managed responsibly has only become more urgent with the instatement of a new EU direc- tive, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (European Union 2016).', 'Valid from May 25, 2018, the direc- tive contains a series of principles that fundamentally reshapes the way data is handled by any organization in order to protect individual rights to data privacy (European Commission 2018).', 'A core difference from previous legislation on the topic of data protection is that organizations are now required to obtain explicit consent from users and in doing so, need to', 'As a tech- nologically advanced society, the Danish government pro- vides a wealth of digital public services, with the result that local government organizations inadvertently collect and store massive amounts of personally sensitive data on citizens, just to perform their duties.', 'Whether their role as a public institu- tion provides statutory basis for collecting these data or if there is a need to procure explicit consent from citizens is a funda- mental question that depends on the intended use, and as such a key issue to be addressed through data governance.', 'Data Collection and Analysis', 'The first author collected empirical data over a period of 4 months using semi-structured group interviews that has the advantages of being inexpensive, data rich, flexible, stimulat- ing to respondents, recall aiding, cumulative and elaborative, over and above individual responses (Fontana and Frey 1994).', 'Since the preliminary understanding of why governing data is difficult was gleaned from existing literature that did not nec- essarily focus explicitly on challenges, the semi-structured group interview allowed us to examine whether these were indeed viable challenges for practitioners, while still allowing participants to bring forth other key points.', 'The participants were members of the abovementioned network and came from several different layers of the local government organi- zations (in Danish termed Bmunicipalities^), ranging from managers, to consultants, project managers and technical ex- perts (see Appendix Table 4 for a list of participants).', 'The group interviews were used in this study to gain empirical data from several hierarchical levels in order to cover a Bvariety of voices^ (Myers and Newman 2007).', 'Municipalities differ across many characteristics, including size and digital maturi- ty.', 'Group interviews across (and among) practitioners in mu- nicipalities therefore allowed for nuances of practice to be brought forth, as the participants could discuss and reflect amongst themselves (Fontana and Frey 1994).', 'The data was collected through six sessions (see Table 2), with the first session on May 5, 2017 and the last on August 24, 2017, which was a year prior to GDPR was instated but without it figuring as a prominent issue in the sessions.', 'Two sessions were of a general character including participants from different municipalities, and three sessions involved par- ticipants from the same municipality.', 'One session only had one participant, and therefore functioned as a classic semi- structured interview (Myers and Newman 2007).', 'The first session introduced data governance as a viable practice (Khatri and Brown 2010) and we received feedback from practitioners regarding the necessity for and utility of such an approach in local government settings.', 'Between ses- sion #1 and #6, the first author conducted four interviews, which had the purpose of unfolding specific barriers, chal- lenges, or difficulties related to working with data.', 'As these', 'Inf Syst Front (2020) 22:299–313', 'Table 2 Activities for data collection', 'Activity', 'Participants', 'General group session

qualitative content analysis (Hsieh and Shannon 2005).', 'First by reading transcripts and field notes, highlighting interesting or relevant parts, and collecting them in a separate document.', 'Upon completion, the extracted quotes were arranged as challenges and named.', 'The material was then coded again, using the newly constructed challenges to collapse any duplicates and reduce potential in- ternal contradictions.', 'The process was repeated until challenges could no longer be created, collapsed or split.', 'In order to reduce potential bias, the last general group session functioned as a site to test the validity of the identified challenges.', 'The last group session had the highest turn out, and thus allowed for valuable refinement of the findings from a variety of perspectives.',

to perceive and ex- press the value-creating potential of data and data governance.', 'Short-term perspectives on usage and a poor understanding of what value data may create, when considered an organization- al asset, complicates the efforts to govern data.', 'A lack of understanding of what data can be used for beyond the context of its immediate practice either presents it as a by-product of working in a digital environment or binds its utility to performing a specific workflow: BMany of those who work with data are not used to thinking of data as an asset […] It’s usually very convenient if [they] can see a citizen in both systems because it’s updated...', 'Development consultant).', 'Another participant describes municipalities as ‘sober’, when it comes to collecting and using data, and frames it as a mindset that needs to be changed, rather than specific processes to be implemented: BA municipality is so- ber: it looks at what we can use data for right now.', 'We have to reverse the approach and acknowledge we have to collect [non-persona] data, even though we do not quite know what we need them for yet, and it’s a mental change of dimensions^ (Head of IT).', 'What needs to happen is a change of the mindset in going from a reactionary to a proactive view on data.', 'However, this will not happen by itself.', 'The employees have to be introduced to the somewhat abstract idea of seeing data as an asset: BPeople need to be told this story that you can see data as either something you depend on in being reactive, or where you consider it an asset [and] become a little more proactive^ (Development consultant).', 'Although participants show enthusiasm and see potential in working more structured with data, they find it challenging to express the potential value to stakeholders in the rest of the organization.', 'Especially framing the value of data initiatives to ensure economic resources for data related projects is diffi- cult: BOur BI (Business Intelligence) system has been three years on the way, and it has taken us long to convince our management to spend just minimal resources on this.', 'It’s hard', 'Collecting personal data without a consented purpose is illegal according to GDPR but local government organizations also have vast amounts of non- personal data.', 'Inf Syst Front (2020) 22:299–313', 'IT architect).', 'Some participants clearly perceive the benefits and poten- tial value of data initiatives, but find it challenging to commu- nicate to executive levels.', 'Others question the value, but hear from other local governments it is ‘the best thing’ to do: BWe find it hard to spot the value ourselves, but we know (…) that someone says it’s just the best thing you can do.', 'It’s also a good foundation [to invest in data governance] and our gut feeling tells us it’s a good idea, but we just want this specific use case that illustrates ‘this is what we’re going to create the foundation for’^ (Financial consultant).', 'What follows is an amalgamation of issues.', 'On one hand, local government practitioners attempt to secure resources to build an appropriate infrastructure for the future use of data, but lack a persuasive, illustrative use case to convince man- agement that investing in data as an asset is relevant.', 'Yet, these organizations find it difficult to perceive any long-term, value- creating opportunities with data, which could lead to the ‘good use case’, because local government employees remain nar- rowly focused on data in the context of day-to-day operations and welfare services.', 'As a result, the overarching goal remains too elusive, intangible, and even confusing for practitioners to mobilize the collective action of data governance.', 'Enabling Collaboration', 'Local government organizations struggle to foster cross- organizational collaboration between different, departmental functions, when it comes to treating data as an organizational asset.', 'If the different departments avoid cooperation, the or- ganizations cannot devise and implement effective data gov- ernance principles that actually enable valuable data sharing across.', 'One of the opportunities many local government orga- nizations are very keen to pursue, is combining all available data about a citizen from several systems across departments within one place.', 'The idea is to gain a ‘360 view of the indi- vidual’.', 'According to the participants, this will have transfor- mative impact on a wide variety of elements, from the way they monitor the effects of specific initiatives to the way they deliver public services to citizens.', 'Yet, to do so, the different departments have to establish tight collaboration with each other, but this is difficult: BYou can have a siloed organisation, and then work together across, with good processes.', 'But we don’t have that.', 'We try to facilitate data-sharing across [Departments] with a BI-project, but those are just the terms.', 'The departments simply don’t collaborate.^ (Financial consul- tant).', 'To enable data to flow across departments with these processes, organizational members have to change behavior to ensure data governance processes and principles are ad- hered to.', 'The wider the distance between what purpose a data governance process or principle serves and the person, who has to adhere to it, the less meaningful it might appear: BThe', 'Head of Digitalization).', 'As such, cross-organizational collaboration and deconstructing siloes become pivotal.', 'Yet, the collabora- tive work required may appear the least meaningful to the employees who are closest to the data, which in turn com- prises potential effort made and the joint greater outcome.', 'Fostering Capabilities', 'Inconsistent capabilities across departments and hierarchal levels make it difficult to envision an overall, strategic direc- tion for the use of data across a local government organization.', 'Data governance entails implementing processes and princi- ples that are supposed to be enterprise-wide.', 'However, it is not necessarily possible to design such an all-encompassing data governance program for a local government organization, be- cause the different departments have varying levels of data management maturity.', 'One important aspect of this maturity is the professional domain.', 'Several local government organi- zations point to the employment sector as very experienced in working with data: BThe field of employment is extremely data-driven and guided by managing information, which it has been for many years and I think it’s easy to notice how the employees have this experience and focus on data quality and data usage^ (Head of Digitalization).', 'On the other hand, the elderly sector is not experienced at all.', 'In one case, they lack basic understanding of IT for their profession: BWe have just reached out to the elder area, because we have to create a digitization strategy.', 'They do not have it in their conscious- ness, and we would like to help them.', 'The first meeting we had, they thought we were there to discuss which PCs they should have and what phones they should buy.', 'And that was probably the last thing we came to discuss^ (Head of IT).', 'The design and implementation of data governance for the organi- zation as a whole depends on the maturity of individual de- partments.', 'Departments’ professional experience and hetero- geneous resources, in either building new or developing existing data capabilities, impacts the quality of data gover- nance as the Bgood^ produced.', 'Data Overview', 'Local government organizations struggle to acquire an over- view of existing data sources.', 'While there is a desire to build appropriate data infrastructure, the current enterprise architec- ture is fragmented and fraught with legacy systems.', 'In many cases, organizations do not have access to some of their own data, as it is stored on servers placed with the vendors, who delivered the original system.', 'Often, these vendors demand high costs for providing access.', 'This contributes a problem, where it is expensive and complicated to gain an overview of', 'Inf Syst Front (2020) 22:299–313', 'BOne thing is the complexity of many different solutions, but it is something else to have 40 years of legacy systems that have been implemented at random.', 'There was no consideration of infrastructure at that time […] we are sitting on a gold mine of data and knowledge that we do not even know about^ (Head of IT).', 'At the forefront is a very concrete obstacle where any intent to make use of data assets is obstructed by the fact, they are downright difficult to access.', 'When no overview exists, it makes exploring potential value- generation for these assets complicated.', 'Without awareness of how data assets should contribute to organizational goals, con- ceiving data governance principles becomes impossible.', 'Local Practices', 'Diverse, local practices make it difficult for local government organizations to design and implement shared data gover- nance principles.', 'Individual departments are highly autono- mous in solving their local government responsibilities, which results in practices that are highly appropriate for the local tasks, but difficult to expand beyond the individual depart- ment.', 'To ensure that data treatment adheres to the principles set forth by the data governance program, some degree of standardization is necessary.', 'Enforcing standardized princi- ples for data treatment in highly specialized and autonomous departments is a central challenge; one which is also pointed to as a distinct feature of the public versus the private sector: BThis is the way you implement decisions, and it is very dif- ferent [from the private sector], because here, there is a lot of ro o m f o r i n t e r p re t a t i o n t h a t m a k e s t h i n g s l e s s straightforward^ (Head of IT).', 'Different departments usually implement a local adaption of a decision that fits their existing practice, rather than follow the standardized directions, an outcome likely to occur with data governance as well.', 'It is not only the practices that are diverse, but also relationships with existing IT professionals: BIdeally, it should be of value, but there is a big difference between speaking to a technical department full of engineers, or [speaking to] nurses, peda- gogues and teachers, because [then] you should really know your visiting hours and how to communicate^ (Development consultant).', 'As such, adopting data governance principles in departments that are used to and comfortable with working with data do not require the same effort as in departments, where exploiting data is not common practice.', 'Political Ambience', 'Mobilization of data governance is a political endeavor.', 'This either manifests as limited attention from politicians and top- level managers, or as skepticism and fear regarding data gov- ernance’s infringement upon existing autonomy.', 'Some partici- pants state that data governance should be on the political', 'To engage political support is a challenge, as there is no established linkage between improving public services and data: BNo politicians can comment on this meaningfully.', 'It is not a political issue in the municipality and when I say that, I mean something like ‘data is important be- cause it can make us a better municipality’ … But it’s not there, it’s only administrative^ (IT architect).', 'According to the partic- ipants, it is because they need the compelling use-case that shows how working structured and systematically with data translates to value in the local government context.', 'They agree that right now, most data initiatives are powered by passionate individuals: BThe passionate cannot drive this alone, because at one point there will be no more passion left.', 'There must be top management support^ (Project manager).', 'While this challenge relates to the difficulty of engaging the political agenda in data matters, achieving this type of top- level support also has other objectives and consequences.', 'Some professionals remain highly skeptical towards data gov- ernance and the role of data in their particular domain.', 'Especially departments within social fields remain distrustful, as their profession is about making individual, subjective judgements regarding sensitive cases: BHere …, it is more feeling for the individual case and [they are asking the ques- tion] what is it even data is.', 'Here, the anxiety [regarding data] is more pronounced^ (Financial consultant).', 'Some profes- sionals see data governance and the increased focus on data- driven decision-making lead to an unwanted scrutiny of their cases.', 'They fear exposure of their work to other parts of the organization, which may result in someone higher up making decisions regarding their domain, based on this data, without consulting them.', 'A fear that others might downright misinter- pret data is apparent: BPeople fear you interpret the data in- correctly, so just trusting that data is being treated and ana- lyzed correctly is a huge change-oriented project in itself^ (Financial consultant).', 'Specialists do not trust that data will be used appropriately or adequately, and therefore remain skeptical about following data governance principles.', 'Consequently, attempting to govern data assets in a local government context is a politically infused endeavor, in that it may either bring great improvements or disturb some funda- mental values.', 'Bringing data usage on the political agenda is thus both an issue of enabling data opportunities and raising awareness regarding its applicability in the public sector, but also constrained by the idea that powerful interests may influ- ence its strategic direction.', 'Discussion', 'In this section, we summarize our research findings into a Bproblem triangle^ (see Fig.', 'Fig.', 'The problem triangle of data governance', 'Inf Syst Front (2020) 22:299–313', 'We consider how results from this study contribute to existing research and we deliberate the findings’ implications for practice and point to directions for future research.', 'The Problem Triangle', 'So far, we have focused on identifying and describing the distinct challenges of data governance.', 'In this section, we submit that these six constituent challenges contribute in mu- tually reinforcing ways to form a problem triangle as illustrat- ed in Fig.', 'The problem triangle demonstrates that mobilizing an or- ganization to engage in data governance is difficult, not only as a result of the individual challenges, but also because these are interdependent and only adequately addressed together.', 'Consequently, we theorize the relationship between chal- lenges #1–3 through their interdependencies with challenges #4–6, as the first three cannot be resolved in isolation, without considering the last three:', 'Perceiving value (#1) requires a fertile political ambience (#6) to position data governance initiatives as desirable within the organizational context, but also an appropriate overview (#4) of which data sources exist to determine their value-creating potential.', 'Enabling collaboration (#2) requires for diverging, local practices (#5) across collaborating functions to make mu- tual adjustments, but also that political ambience (#6) offer', 'Fostering capabilities (#3) requires a suitable overview (#4) of what specific types of data resources to account for, while paying attention to how various local practices (#5) currently foster certain specific capabilities.', 'In parallel, challenges #1–3 in some way also reinforce challenges #4–6, indicating that the last three cannot be inde- pendently addressed because they are constituted by the first three:', 'Data overview (#4) remains inadequate due to a lack of the right capabilities (#3) across departments to actually establish an accurate overview and further exacerbated by fundamental difficulties in perceiving the value (#1) of having such an overview of data assets.', 'Local practices (#5) remain difficult to consolidate due to lack of cross-functional collaboration (#2) on data initia- tives and further restrained by the varying maturities of data capabilities (#3) across the collaborating functions.', 'Political ambience (#6) remains influenced by the limited ability to perceive the value (#1) of data as meaningful and enabling in a political context and further affected by the lack of cross-functional collaboration (#3) needed to envi- sion the potential of using data to transform public services.', 'We suggest that the problem triangle, with the delineated relationships between the six challenges, represents data', 'Inf Syst Front (2020) 22:299–313', 'Perceiving value of data governance is challenging be- cause actors in a collective tend to ascribe different mean- ings to the purpose or outcome of the collective action.', 'Enabling collaboration between functions on data gover- nance is complicated because actors tend to take actions that protect their individual interests at the expense of achieving a greater joint outcome.', 'Fostering capabilities for governing data is difficult be- cause doing so requires effectively managing heteroge- neous resources contributed by different actors to the com- mon Bgood^ produced in a collective.', 'When we adopt a collective action lens to consider the governance aspect of data governance, it brings underlying issues, such as data overview, local practices and political ambience to the forefront.', 'Recognizing data governance as a collective action problem rather than an exercise in assigning accountabilities also encourages markedly different avenues for improvement.', 'Solving such dilemmas often requires alter- ing payoffs through governance arrangements to realign indi- vidual decisions that together result in the desired joint out- come (Torfing and Ansell 2016).', 'Contribution to Existing Research', 'Previous research offers valuable input on how to design and conceive of data governance as an organization-wide program (Alhassan et al.', 'Brous et al.', 'Otto 2011a; 2011c; Weber et al.', 'Our research contributes to the data governance literature with a theory-informed empirical account of the intricacies involved in mobilizing an organiza- tion to engage in data governance.', 'This reveals a complexity that go well beyond existing, seminal work within the field (Begg and Caira 2012; Thompson et al.', 'Vilminko- Heikkinen et al.', 'On the other hand, our findings also resonate with research on broader issues in e-government and indicate that data governance is difficult, because the inherent challenges are tied to the core of what it means to do public administration in a digital society.', 'More impor- the similarities between our challenges and tantly, known e-government issues, such as competing value positions (Rose et al.', 'Juell-Skielse et al.', 'Kim and Grant 2010), demonstrate the utility in perceiving data governance in local', 'Elaborately designed data governance policies are likely to fall short, when introduced into complex, organiza- tional realities, if data governance research continues to retain its narrow focus on how to define principles and assign accountabilities, without considering how value, capabilities, collaboration, overview, practices, and poli- tics factor in and constitute an interrelated problem.', 'Implications and Suggestions for Future Research', 'In the words of American, pragmatist philosopher John Dewey, B…a problem well put is half solved.', 'To mis- take the problem involved is to cause subsequent inqui- ry to be irrelevant.', 'Without a problem, there is blind groping in the dark^ (Dewey 1938, p.', 'The prevail- ing lack of a common direction of inquiry (Al-Ruithe et al.', 'Benfeldt Nielsen 2017; Brous et al.', 'Yet, if formulation of research problems is taken for granted or not made explicit, it is likely that essential characteristics remain overlooked, resulting in inadequate or misdirected solu- tions (Volkema 1995).', 'As such, previous IS literature have argued for the particular advantage of formulating f o r ) p r a c t i t i o n e r s r e s e a r c h pr ob l e m s w i t h ( n o t (Mathiassen 2002; P.', 'A.', 'Nielsen and Persson 2016).', 'While engagement with practice by scholars is neces- sary because most real world problems are too complex to be captured by any one perspective (Van de Ven 2007, p.', 'Defining them therefore necessarily requires deliberate framing with relevant stakeholders.', 'By engaging with practitioners in deter- mining why governing data is difficult, this paper has several implications, both for practice and future research.', 'Our findings demonstrate that data governance in lo- that re- cal government quires more than just the designation of roles and re- sponsibilities.', 'Data governance requires attention to a complex, organizational reality, where six intricate chal- lenges form a collective action problem and implicate even broader issues, known in existing e-government literature.', 'In previous research, Bparadoxes^ (Vilminko- Heikkinen et al.', 'Bwill only remain temporary and cause tension^ (p.', 'Although we argue data gover- nance is a collective action problem, our conception of Bchallenges^ constitutes a more useful frame for local government practitioners by breaking the grander prob- lem down into manageable issues.', 'The notion of', 'Inf Syst Front (2020) 22:299–313', 'In any case, creative, breakthrough ideas often come from spending time understanding the problem and exploring its boundaries (Volkema 1995).', 'While practitioners are keen to pursue data related opportunities, they struggle with mobilizing their entire organization to adopt data governance, according to the findings of this study.', 'The heterogeneity and lack of collaboration between subgroups in the form of depart- ments and professional domains pose a great challenge to a fundamental tenet of data governance, namely that it should be approached from the top-down as an orga- nization wide approach (Begg and Caira 2012; Vilminko-Heikkinen et al.', 'Here, the analytical value of employing a collective action perspective on data governance also emerges.', 'Previous research has focused on isolated aspects, such as determining general principles (Brous et al.', 'Alhassan et al.', 'Our study suggests that mobilizing an organization to actually adhere to these aspects is a matter of en- abling collective action between heterogeneous actors with different motivations and resources.', 'A central im- plication for practice is thus to address the significant governance challenge, which consists of realigning these individual interests to achieve a greater joint outcome.', 'Returning to Constantinides and Barrett’s study on governing information infrastructures (Constantinides they propose Bprogressive nesting^ and Barrett 2015), as a solution.', 'Here, governance is not initially defined from a centralized, top-down perspective as proposed in some data governance approaches (Khatri and Brown 2010), but rather progressively nested.', 'For example, groups of local government actors self-organize on prin- ciples regarding their own data assets, but as soon as it leads to spill over into other domains, an overarching principle must be established.', 'As such, data governance is Bnested to a higher level^.', 'Practitioners can employ this bottom-up process to progressively define more de- tailed governance rules, which may eventually cover the entire organization, while to a large extent still accom- modating the heterogeneity of individual departmental responsibilities.', 'If engaging in IS research is viewed as a problem- solving process, where any theory developed or solution conceived is directly predicated on the nature of the research problem (Gregor 2006), there is significant val- ue in theorizing an IS problem with practitioners before', 'Van de Ven 2007).', 'Our proposition that data governance may be understood as a collective action problem thus opens up a plethora of new avenues for IS research on the topic of data governance.', 'We propose that future research delves into mitigating the constituent issues of the problem triangle (Fig.', 'Also, studies that explore how to achieve aforemen- tioned form of bottom-up governance for data assets as a way to address the challenges are encouraged.', 'Understanding value in the context of governing data appears to be a particularly wicked and pervasive chal- lenge, where studies that specifically examine how to define and convey data value could benefit both practi- tioners and researchers.', 'Finally, we must emphasize that our investigation of chal- lenges with data governance is limited to the views within local government organizations.', 'Involving citizens is a very important direction for future data governance research, and also a well-known problem in the e-government literature (Medaglia 2012; Medaglia et al.', 'Olphert and Damodaran 2007; Rose et al.', 'With the instatement of GDPR, where individual data privacy rights move to the forefront, engaging citizens to determine how to best govern sensitive, personal data will only become more important (Winter and Davidson 2018).', 'We urge data governance re- searchers to explore this avenue in further detail.', 'Conclusion', 'Data governance research has focused on isolated aspects, with little attention paid to how practitioners introduce data governance into a complex, organizational reality.', 'Our inves- tigation of Danish local government contributes fresh insights into why governing data is difficult, namely due to six inter- related challenges: perceiving value, enabling collaboration, fostering capabilities, data overview, local practices and polit- ical ambience.', 'We explicate the relationship between these challenges in a problem triangle and demonstrate both theo- retical and practical implications of viewing data governance as a collective action problem, where local government actors with heterogenous, potentially conflicting, interests struggle to find value in and act together towards a common goal.', 'We suggest our problem triangle may assist practitioners in local government organizations to better understand the com- plexity they face, when attempting to mobilize their organiza- tions and formally govern their data assets.', 'Moreover, our findings can inspire researchers to study data governance be- yond large-scale, company-wide programs that primarily fo- cus on the assignment of accountabilities.', 'Inf Syst Front (2020) 22:299–313', 'Appendix 1', 'Table 4 Note: This data is mandatory.', 'Please provide', 'Municipality', 'Title', 'Workshop 1', 'A A A A A A Z', 'Y B B B B B

 potential of value creation based on data.', 'In this context, data governance has become an emerging topic in  recent IS literature as organizations require a more sophisticated approach over the management of their  data assets.', 'However, the implications of organizations interacting within new forms of inter-organizational  collaborations have not been sufficiently explored.', 'We first elaborate on the  topic of data governance to  derive intra- and inter-organizational characteristics of data governance.', 'Using a case study approach, we  examine three firms developing data-driven business models that rely on ecosystems in their business-to- business  (B2B)  operations.', 'We  analyze  new  implications  arising  to  each  individual  with  regard  to  data  governance and indicate that data governance requires a broader research perspective, one that takes the  dynamics outside a single organization in ecosystems into consideration.', 'Keywords ', 'Data Governance, data management, data ecosystem, ecosystem governance.', 'Introduction ', 'The  emergence  of  ecosystems  around  platform-based  infrastructures  continuously  demonstrate  the  potential of value creation based on data (de Reuver et al.', 'Hein et al.', 'As data acts as an enabler  for data-driven business models, its significance in the digital age is indisputable (Dallumule and Davenport  2017).', 'This development not only breaks organizational boundaries as internal data is increasingly used  externally  and  vice  versa.', 'It  also  requires  organizations  to  find  an  equilibrium  between  the  opposing  interests of having control over their data assets and willing to share data to design and deliver common  value  propositions  (Otto  and  Jarke  2019).', 'In  this  context,  the  role  of  data  governance  has  increasingly  gained awareness and  became an  emerging topic in recent IS literature as organizations require a more  sophisticated approach over the conduct of their data assets (Abraham et al.', 'The paradigm shift towards considering the significance of data as a strategic resource as well as an external  view with inter-organizational data sharing are phenomena that just begin to gain research attention in the  context of data governance.', 'The rise of ecosystems underlines the need to review data governance from an  inter-organizational perspective, as novel forms of collaboration between various actors lack concepts  in  enforcing governance mechanisms for data and challenge established practices (de Prieëlle et al.', 'The  dynamics  within  ecosystems  are  more  complicated  and  diverse  because  value-creation  processes,  governance and ownership structures over data become less transparent (Otto and Jarke 2019).', 'Authors  therefore emphasize the necessity to extend research on data governance beyond the organizational sphere  (Abraham et al.', 'Prieëlle et al.', 'Lee and Jeffery 2018).', 'As  the  knowledge  on  data  governance  specifically  from  an  external  perspective  and  its  resulting  implications  are  still  in  its  infancy,  this  paper  attempts  to  advance  research  by  linking  the  intra-', 'Americas Conference on Information Systems ', 'Data Governance in Data Ecosystems ', 'This leads to the following research questions that guide our research goals:  ', 'R:  How  does  the  role  of  data  governance  differ  from  an  internal  (intra-organizational)  and  external  (inter-organizational) perspective?', 'R: Which challenges do organizations encounter with regard to data governance when engaging in inter- organizational data ecosystems?', 'To  apprehend  emerging  implications  to  organizations  from  the  engagement  in  data  ecosystems,  it  is  essential  to  initially  understand  the  conceptual  difference  between  an  intra-organizational  and  inter- organizational perspective on data governance.', 'Thus, the first section elaborates on central terms and gives  a conceptual distinction between the two perspectives.', 'The remaining part of the paper proceeds as follows:  The next section describes the methodological approach.', 'We conducted an in-depth analysis of three case  studies with three different organizations and different domains.', 'For each case study, we investigate how  the  interaction  in  inter-organizational  settings  influences  existing  activities  around  data  within  the  organization.', 'The final section provides a conclusion while briefly outlining limitations of the paper.', 'Background ', 'Intra-Organizational Data Governance ', 'To understand the link from internal to external data governance, we build upon the work by Abraham et  al.', 'Within the intra-organizational perspective, we consider the body of knowledge of existing and  established  practices  around  data  governance  which  mainly  focus  on  the  practices  inside  a  single  organization.', 'The  majority  of  the  contributions  within  the  intra-organizational  are  derived  from  IT  governance research based on Weill (2004).', 'However, the initially proposed approaches derived from the  governance of physical IT assets could not be applied specifically to the notion of data as a digital company  asset  (Wende  2007).', 'Over  time,  the  term  data  governance  has  embodied  a  multitude  of  concepts  with  varying constituents to what explicitly belongs to the domain of data governance (Korhonen et al.', 'Otto 2011; Weber et al.', 'As  many definitions  build upon the definition of IT  governance  by Weill  (2004), the key characteristics of data  governance  also remain stable,  which are the provision decision- rights, roles, and accountabilities for the management and use of data (Abraham et al.', 'More practical  oriented  views  on  data  governance  often  include  elements  that  emphasize  the  importance  of  data  as  a  strategic resource, or valuable asset, that aims at maximizing the value of data for an enterprise (Khatri and  Brown 2010; Otto 2015; Weber et al.', 'The  subject  of  analysis  in  the  intra-organizational  perspective  lies  on  how  to  set  up  organizational  structures,  use  governance  mechanisms  to  improve  data  quality,  manage  resources  across  a  single  organization and define guidelines for the management of data (Al-Ruithe et al.', 'De Haes and Van  Grembergen 2004; Otto 2011; Wende 2007).', 'From an internal perspective of an organization, the execution  of decision rights for the management and use of data manifests itself within organizational structures and  hierarchies.', 'They  ensure  that  relevant  guidelines  and  principles  regarding  data  assets  are  in  place  and  monitored  (Weber  et  al.', 'However,  traditional  instruments  for  assigning  decision  rights  and  accountabilities in terms of data  access and use  usually do not reach beyond organizational  borders (de  Prieëlle et al.', 'Thus, the influence of authority for the individual entity might be limited in an inter- organizational setting.', 'For organizations to understand how to position and organize themselves in  data  ecosystems,  it  is  essential  to  know  which  role  to  embrace  and  the  implications  arising  from  certain  collaborations (Otto and Jarke 2019).', 'Inter-Organizational Data Governance  ', 'While the  majority of the scientific state of art on data governance  builds upon  the  intra-organizational  perspective, little is known about data governance including the external perspective and the link towards  it  (Abraham  et  al.', 'Alhassan  et  al.', 'The  inter-organizational  perspective  on  data  governance  involves  data  sharing  between  organizations  and  often  evolve  around  platform-based  technical  infrastructures (de Prieëlle et al.', 'Here, we focus on data ecosystems because the focal point of our  analysis lies on actors within networks of organizations that engage in data sharing for the co-creation of ', 'Americas Conference on Information Systems ', 'Data Governance in Data Ecosystems ', 'Oliveira et al.', 'As data ecosystems highly depend on  the  provision  of  data,  the  question  arises,  which  governance  mechanisms  support  a  collaborative  and  trustful environment for all actors involved (de Prieëlle et al.', 'Initial ideas in advancing the knowledge towards an external perspective have recently begun to examine  data governance in the case of digital platforms  (Lee  et al.', 'Schreieck et al.', 'The focal of the  authors often lies in the combination of data governance associated with a platform’s success.', 'Some authors  refer to the concept of an inter-organizational perspective as ecosystem governance (Van den Broek and  Van  Veenstra  2015;  Otto  and  Jarke  2019).', 'Ecosystem  governance  describes  the  establishment  of  a  collaborative environment, in which all actors interact in line with common value propositions and benefit  from the integration and use of collective resources e.g. data (Van den Broek and Van Veenstra 2015).', 'This  development  transcends  organizational  boundaries  because  internal  data  can  be  used  externally  or  vice  versa in the case of using/buying external data for internal purposes (Otto and Jarke 2019).', 'However, the  implications to organizations by engaging in data sharing activities to achieve common service and value  propositions are yet to be analyzed.', 'To improve our understanding of the associated challenges evolving  from  inter-organizational  data  sharing,  the  conceptual  differentiation  between  the  internal  and  external  perspective on data governance turns out to be an important factor, as the range of authority for traditional  (internal) governance instruments is limited in the context of data ecosystems.', 'Table 1 provides an

plants.', 'A data governance policy is in  place in the overarching business area, but does not include specific guidelines regarding the management  of  large  volumes  of  sensor  data  in  the  described  scenario.', 'The  industrial  manufacturer  seeks  to  ensure  readiness for future data-driven business models by combining long-existing product expertise with digital  services.', 'The established practice leads to a discontinuity of information flow from produced machines once  the installation and operation are carried out.', 'Little is known about machine usage and the general state of  the machine at the customer’s site.', 'In case of technical issues, maintenance services are time-intensive and  operated a posteriori.', 'The target state is a data-driven hybrid value proposition with physical machines and  data-enabled services for the customer.', 'Case Beta – Data-driven business model for traffic and environmental data ', 'Case Beta describes a medium-sized enterprise with over 30 years of experience in the provision of services  in the mobile telecommunications and telematics domain.', 'The established practice is focused on request- based projects with

radio network on a specifically planned route.', 'The order is completed when the data set is transferred to  the  MNO.', 'Data  governance  activities  are  informally  practiced  on  a  project-by-project  basis.', 'The  project  team of case Beta recognizes the necessity of data governance to manage the data-driven business models  sustainably.', 'The firm plans to transform the contract-based operation toward a more flexible approach at  their own initiative.', 'Instead of “just selling” the information to one entity, the organization aims at creating  new business models based on the commercialization of more diverse data sets including environmental  data e.g. data on traffic, weather or city noise.', 'Americas Conference on Information Systems ', 'Data Governance in Data Ecosystems ', 'Case Gamma – Operation of a data marketplace platform ', 'In  comparison  to  the  previous  organizations,  case  Gamma  represents  a  business  scenario  from  the  perspective of a startup.', 'The startup offers consult in digital transformation initiatives.', 'The focus in case  Gamma lies in the development and operation of a data marketplace platform for providers and consumers  of  data.', 'The  marketplace  has  a  multilateral  business  offering  that  provides  an  infrastructure  for  both  internal and external data exchange.', 'The strategic goal behind the data marketplace is to enable secure data  exchange  between  marketplace  users  and  to  fuel  collaborative  data-driven  business  models.', 'Additional  functionalities  of  the  infrastructure  are  the  provision  of  open  data,  analytics  services,  and  collaboration  between external stakeholders.', 'Case Analysis ', 'Analysis – Case Alpha  ', 'From an organizational perspective, there is little experience with data-driven services.', 'Unlike digital native  companies, whose business models are mainly digital and whose success especially emerged within the last  two  decades,  the  manufacturer  is  currently  adapting  a  digital  strategy.', 'Approaching  from  a  brownfield  development,  the  manufacturer  especially  possesses  historical  and  physical  product  expertise.', 'To  date,  tasks  and  responsibilities  for  the  management  of  data  were  mostly  project-based  and  rather  informal  without  a  data  governance  framework  in  place.', 'Workshop  -1-  lead  to  the  realization  that  within  the  organization, data governance can be assured through internal guidelines and mechanisms for mandating  data  roles  and  assign  responsibilities.', 'These  internal  mechanisms  are  anchored  within  organizational  structures  like  the  definition  of  responsibilities  or  data  standards.', 'With  regard  to  the  customer,  these  mechanisms are no longer valid or cannot be demanded without considering adequate legislation.', 'Another important finding was that the manufacturer depends on and is limited to functionalities provided  by the platform software  vendor.', 'In this context, the  manufacturer has to consider technical limitations  when adapting to internal practices.', 'This implies a re-design of data governance functions concerning data  standards and responsible roles for the platform.', 'While the platform infrastructure currently lies within the  responsibility of technical IT staff, the newly generated service offering urges closer collaboration between  interdisciplinary teams.', 'The co-existing physical and “data products” require the expertise combining the  domains of data, engineering and  business.', 'Additional implications result from the product lifecycles of  cement machines, which are very long in comparison to digital lifecycles.', 'Product durability of over twenty  years  can  produce  significant  data  volumes  and  urges  long-term  solutions  for  adequate  metadata  management,  data  security,  and  data  availability.', 'This  outcome  shows  that  physical  and  digital  service  offering go hand in hand.', 'Further implications result from uncertainties regarding the ownership status  and transparency of machine data.', 'Analysis – Case Beta  ', 'The perspective of case Beta differs from the previously analyzed perspective of case Alpha in terms of the  platform  role.', 'The  SME  specializes  in  telecommunication  services  and  does  not  provide  a  platform- infrastructure  but acts as a provider of data.', 'The  workshop  participants agreed  that in the case of  Beta,  customer  orientation  is  key  to  identify  which  data  might  be  relevant  and  of  value.', 'Organization  Beta  requires an internal data evaluation approach to provide information on the value of data, similar to a “price  tag” for its data assets.', 'The decision about which sensors to install in the vehicle for data collection highly  depend on the relevancy and demand from the customer’s perspective.', 'Thus, organization Beta requires a  co-existing portfolio of virtual data products besides their physical product portfolios of telecommunication  components.', 'From a technical perspective and specifically of importance for data governance, the workshop  participants identified the generation of a mutual understanding for the data as a highly important task.', 'It  concludes  the  definition  of  consistent  data  standards.', 'Especially  the  data  inventory  and  annotation  of  metadata are essential activities for being able to identify, select, combine, and evaluate relevant data  to  build several data products.', 'In contrast to case Alpha, the organization behind case Beta does not run its  own  technical  platform  infrastructure.', 'Implications  emerging  from  this  relate  specifically  to  the  loss  of  control of their own data assets and lack of transparency over the usage of data on external platforms.', 'Americas Conference on Information Systems ', 'Data Governance in Data Ecosystems ', 'Analysis – Case Gamma ', 'A  common  view  amongst  workshop  participants  in  workshop  -1-  regarding  case  Gamma  and  its  data  marketplace  platform  was  that  the  aspect  of  trust  is  of  substantial  importance.', 'Two  discrete  reasons  emerged from this view.', 'First, the platform market is turbulent as many similar platforms emerged recently.', 'Second,  to  sustain  an  important  position  as  a  trusted  data  marketplace  in  the  market,  the  organization  behind case Gamma has to take into consideration data consumers and data providers alike.', 'The design of  the data marketplace in terms of technical infrastructure, architecture, and openness have an impact on the  level of control  and transparency.', 'Organization Gamma recognized different governance  mechanisms to  manage users in the marketplace.', 'The design of the marketplace and the correlating data governance factors  are elementary to deal with the involvement of external users, technical complexity, control, and growth of  the platform.', 'The organization behind case Gamma needs to take various dynamics into account that impact  the success but also the governance of data on the data platform.', 'The organization is urged to motivate data  providers  to  share  and  exchange  data  through  the  marketplace  platform.', 'It  encompasses  governance  mechanisms to control and monitor the quality of the provided data.', 'Additionally, users of the marketplace  expect simple access, the provision of high quality data, and the use of common standards to harness data  assets.', 'Another finding emerged from the observation that organization  Gamma  does not have complex  organizational structures so that more flexibility towards the development of the data marketplace platform  is possible.', 'In comparison to the large enterprise behind case Alpha, implementation and reaction times of  decision-making processes and accountabilities for data are less time consuming.', 'Overview of Data Governance Challenges   ', 'With  regard  to  R,  table  4  provides  an  overview  of  the  main  implications  to  each  organization  from  engaging in

case studies and implications to data governance  as a result of an engagement inter-organizational in ecosystems.', 'It can be noted that organizations are faced  with different technical, organizational and environmental implications due to the engagement in inter- organizational  collaborations.', 'Although  the  motivation  to  initiate  data  governance  programs  differs  between the organizations, data governance appears to be relevant for all cases despite their organizational  context, domain or size.', 'The realization of the cases strongly depend on anchoring and formalizing adequate  conduct over data within the organizations, which is why the role of data governance is  regarded as  key  within each case.', 'The findings of this research demonstrate that inadequate conduct over data assets within  the organization is a major challenge as it not only hinders the adoption to data platforms, but can even  slow entry to market for the commercialization of data assets novel services.', 'With regard to R, the cases  demonstrate that it is essential for each organization to understand its “playing field” and role within data  ecosystems as the range of data governance mechanisms vary depending on the position the organization  is operating in.', 'For instance, in case Alpha and Gamma, the organizations are in control of the technical  platform infrastructure.', 'Thus, they possess more control mechanisms and can influence user interaction  and  data  management.', 'In  case  Beta,  the  organization  does  not  have  these  controls  without  owning  a  technical infrastructure for the provision of their data.', 'They are dependent and need to adopt to external  data platforms or direct customer interactions.', 'There is a bifocal perspective on the governance of platforms as organizations can embrace different roles  e.g.  platform  owner  or  platform  user.', 'Case  Alpha  (manufacturer  platform)  and  case  Gamma  (data  marketplace platform) exhibit examples of platform owners, while case Beta (selling data e.g. via platforms)  potentially engages as a platform user.', 'We argue that platform owners possess a higher level of influence  and  authority  over  data  within  the  platform.', 'Hence,  platform  owners  can  execute  various  governance  mechanisms  as  these  decisions  lie  within  a  controllable  environment  within  the  organization  as  differentiated in table 1.', 'Here, they are capable of controlling the dynamics and interactions between actors  within  the  platform.', 'In  contrast,  users  of  platforms  have  limited  authority  and  control  mechanisms.', 'Platform users as in case Beta need to consider the implications that arise from the interaction with external  platforms e.g. mandatory data standards or authoritative entry barriers (fees for platform participation).', 'Beyond the influential sphere of an organization or platform, little is known about who uses the data for  which  purpose,  and  with  whom  the  data  is  shared  subsequently  in  the  process.', 'Thus,  the  influence  of  authority for the individual actor within an ecosystem might be limited.', 'With regard to RQ 1, traditional instruments for assigning decision rights and accountabilities in terms of  how to manage data lie within the scope of the intra-organizational perspective.', 'As depicted in table 1, usual ', 'Americas Conference on Information Systems ', 'Data Governance in Data Ecosystems ', 'This organizational set-up  is anchored within the  hierarchy of the organization  and has similar characteristics to a “legislative authority”.', 'Within the intra-organizational perspective, data  governance  mostly  focuses  on  internally  produced  data  generated  by  business  processes.', 'The  presented  cases  demonstrate  that  organizations  lay  the  foundations  internally  for  successfully  engaging  in  inter- organizational  data  sharing.', 'This  includes  knowing:  which  data  is  existent  and  relevant  within  the  organization; who is responsible or can provide information related to these data assets; how the data is  used (both internally and externally) and under which conditions data can be shared with whom and where.', 'These new external aspects exceed and challenge traditional tasks and responsibilities of dedicated data  roles  within  the  intra-organizational  sphere  because  data  can  also  be  in  control  of  external  entities  as  depicted in case Alpha (machine data operated by customers).', 'Conclusion ', 'This research project is motivated by the lack of research on data governance in general, and specifically  within the domain of data ecosystems.', 'It aims at contributing to both academics and practitioners on both  domains.', 'As the role of data has changed to becoming a strategically relevant asset for many actors, we find  that  data  governance  is  an  emerging  research  topic  that  still  requires  further  analysis  within  this  new  setting.', 'The  three  practical  case  studies  investigated  under  real-life  settings  provide  valuable  practical  insights on new and diverse challenges caused by inter-organizational interactions.', 'Data managers can use  that information to derive  requirements for building  more transparency over the entire data lifecycle  or  adjust  role  descriptions  with  new  tasks  evolving  from  external  requirements.', 'As  many  businesses  are  currently  adapting  digital  strategies  and  new  business  models,  the  study  shows  that  organizations  of  all  sizes  recognize  the  necessity  of  data  governance,  yet  often  lack  the  adequate  tools  for  implementation.', 'Researchers can draw upon the practical insights and scope it within their specific domain and contribution.', 'In  light  of  existing  research,  the  scientific  contribution  of  this  paper  links  the  intra-perspective  of  an  organization  with  its  external  sphere,  a  linkage  that  has  not  been  considered  in  detail  yet.', 'Research  on  collaborative  governance  mechanisms  that  enable  co-value  creation  while  protecting  the  interests  of  all  actors is also in its infancy.', 'Recent IS researchers made great contributions to advancing the body of knowledge on data governance.', 'A  majority highlights data governance mechanisms and factors in the context of platform ecosystems (Hein  et al.', 'Schreieck et al.', 'Lee et al.', 'The research attention lies in the analysis of successful  platform  examples  derived  from  business  cases  of  digital  native  companies  like  Google  or  Facebook.', 'As  these  cases  have  a  strong  business-to-customer  focus,  they  are  limited  in  the  generalizability  for  the  representation of organizations coming from traditional domains interacting in  B2b operations as in the  analyzed  cases.', 'This  field  still  requires  further  research  as  the  skill-set  differentiates  from  digital  native  companies.', 'Existing roles specifically dedicated to data-related tasks and responsibilities require extension  in the role description as seen in Case Beta for determining the role that sets a price for data assets.', 'With  regard to limitations, this paper encompasses solely German-based organizations, which can influence the  generalizability  of  the  results.', 'Additionally,  the  data  collection  was  limited  to  the  scope  of  the  research  project.', 'As the analysis of data governance is still part of ongoing research, the authors seek to extend the  research with a wider range of firms and industries in data ecosystems.', 'Additional empirical studies can  reveal differences in geography, industry, organizational size and improve the maturity of investigation in  data governance and the effectiveness of mechanisms both internal and external.', 'We seek to draw upon the  challenges to derive specific requirements for data governance factors as part of ongoing project activities.', 'Acknowledgement ', 'We thank the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy for funding

data assets.', 'However, the implications of organizations interacting within new forms of inter-organizational  collaborations have not been sufficiently explored.', 'We first elaborate on the  topic of data governance to  derive intra- and inter-organizational characteristics of data governance.', 'Using a case study approach, we  examine three firms developing data-driven business models that rely on ecosystems in their business-to- business  (B2B)  operations.', 'We  analyze  new  implications  arising  to  each  individual  with  regard  to  data  governance and indicate that data governance requires a broader research perspective, one that takes the  dynamics outside a single organization in ecosystems into consideration.', 'Keywords ', 'Data Governance, data management, data

development not only breaks organizational boundaries as internal data is increasingly used  externally  and  vice  versa.', 'It  also  requires  organizations  to  find  an  equilibrium  between  the  opposing  interests of having control over their data assets and willing to share data to design and deliver common  value  propositions  (Otto  and  Jarke  2019).', 'In  this  context,  the  role  of  data  governance  has  increasingly  gained awareness and  became an  emerging topic in recent IS literature as organizations require a more  sophisticated approach over the conduct of their data assets (Abraham et al.', 'The paradigm shift towards considering the significance of data as a strategic resource as well as an external  view with inter-organizational data sharing are phenomena that just begin to gain research attention in the  context of data governance.', 'The rise of ecosystems underlines the need to review data governance from an  inter-organizational perspective, as novel forms of collaboration between various actors lack concepts  in  enforcing governance mechanisms for data and challenge established practices (de Prieëlle et al.', 'The  dynamics  within  ecosystems  are  more  complicated  and  diverse  because  value-creation  processes,  governance and ownership structures over data become less transparent (Otto and Jarke 2019).', 'Authors  therefore emphasize the necessity to extend research on data governance beyond the organizational sphere  (Abraham et al.', 'Prieëlle et al.', 'Lee and Jeffery 2018).', 'As  the  knowledge  on  data  governance

governance  differ  from  an  internal  (intra-organizational)  and  external  (inter-organizational) perspective?', 'R: Which challenges do organizations encounter with regard to data governance when engaging in inter- organizational data ecosystems?', 'To  apprehend  emerging  implications  to  organizations  from  the  engagement  in  data  ecosystems,  it  is  essential  to  initially  understand  the  conceptual  difference  between  an  intra-organizational  and  inter- organizational perspective on data governance.', 'Thus, the first section elaborates on central terms and gives  a conceptual distinction between the two perspectives.', 'The remaining part of the paper proceeds as follows:  The next section describes the methodological approach.', 'We conducted an in-depth

knowledge of existing and  established  practices  around  data  governance  which  mainly  focus  on  the  practices  inside  a  single  organization.', 'The  majority  of  the  contributions  within  the  intra-organizational  are  derived  from  IT  governance research based on Weill (2004).', 'However, the initially proposed approaches derived from the  governance of physical IT assets could not be applied specifically to the notion of data as a digital company  asset  (Wende  2007).', 'Over  time,  the  term  data  governance  has  embodied  a  multitude  of  concepts  with  varying constituents to what explicitly belongs to the domain of data governance (Korhonen et al.', 'Otto 2011; Weber et al.', 'As  many definitions  build upon the definition of IT  governance  by Weill  (2004), the key characteristics of data  governance  also remain stable,  which are the provision decision- rights, roles, and accountabilities for the management and use of data (Abraham et al.', 'More practical  oriented  views  on  data  governance  often  include  elements  that  emphasize  the  importance  of  data  as  a  strategic resource, or valuable asset, that aims at maximizing the value of data for an enterprise (Khatri and  Brown 2010; Otto 2015; Weber et al.', 'The  subject  of  analysis  in  the  intra-organizational  perspective  lies  on  how  to  set  up  organizational  structures,  use  governance  mechanisms  to  improve  data  quality,  manage  resources  across  a  single  organization and define guidelines for the management of data (Al-Ruithe et al.', 'De Haes

are  anchored  within  organizational  structures  like  the  definition  of  responsibilities  or  data  standards.', 'With  regard  to  the  customer,  these  mechanisms are no longer valid or cannot be demanded without considering adequate legislation.', 'Another important finding was that the manufacturer depends on and is limited to functionalities provided  by the platform software  vendor.', 'In this context, the  manufacturer has to consider technical limitations  when adapting to internal practices.', 'This implies a re-design of data governance functions concerning data  standards and responsible roles for the platform.', 'While the platform infrastructure currently lies within the  responsibility of technical IT staff, the newly generated service offering urges

differs from the previously analyzed perspective of case Alpha in terms of the  platform  role.', 'The  SME  specializes  in  telecommunication  services  and  does  not  provide  a  platform- infrastructure  but acts as a provider of data.', 'The  workshop  participants agreed  that in the case of  Beta,  customer  orientation  is  key  to  identify  which  data  might  be  relevant  and  of  value.', 'Organization  Beta  requires an internal data evaluation approach to provide information on the value of data, similar to a “price  tag” for its data assets.', 'The decision about which sensors to install in the vehicle for data collection highly  depend on the relevancy and demand from the customer’s perspective.', 'Thus, organization Beta requires a  co-existing portfolio of virtual data products besides their physical product portfolios of telecommunication  components.', 'From a technical perspective and specifically of importance for data governance, the workshop  participants identified the generation of a mutual understanding for the data as a highly important task.', 'It  concludes  the  definition  of  consistent  data  standards.', 'Especially  the  data  inventory  and  annotation  of  metadata are essential activities for being able to identify, select, combine, and evaluate relevant data  to  build several data products.', 'In contrast to case Alpha, the organization behind case Beta does not run its  own  technical  platform  infrastructure.', 'Implications  emerging  from  this  relate  specifically  to  the  loss  of  control of their own data assets and lack of transparency over the usage of data on external platforms.', 'Americas Conference on Information Systems ', 'Data Governance in Data Ecosystems ', 'Analysis – Case Gamma ', 'A  common  view  amongst  workshop  participants  in  workshop  -1-  regarding  case  Gamma  and  its  data  marketplace  platform  was  that  the  aspect  of  trust  is  of  substantial  importance.', 'Two  discrete  reasons  emerged from this view.', 'First, the platform market is turbulent as many similar platforms emerged recently.', 'Second,  to  sustain  an  important  position  as  a  trusted  data  marketplace  in  the  market,  the  organization  behind case Gamma has to take into consideration data consumers and data providers alike.', 'The design of  the data marketplace in terms of technical infrastructure, architecture, and openness have an impact on the  level of control  and transparency.', 'Organization Gamma recognized different governance  mechanisms to  manage users in the marketplace.', 'The design of the marketplace and the correlating data governance factors  are elementary to deal with the involvement of external users, technical complexity, control, and growth of  the platform.', 'The organization behind case Gamma needs to take various dynamics into account that impact  the success but also the governance of data on the data platform.', 'The organization is urged to motivate data  providers  to  share  and  exchange  data  through  the  marketplace  platform.', 'It  encompasses  governance  mechanisms to control and monitor the quality of the provided data.', 'Additionally, users of the marketplace  expect simple access, the provision of high quality data, and the use of common standards to harness data  assets.', 'Another finding emerged from the observation that organization  Gamma  does not have complex  organizational structures so that more flexibility towards the development of the data marketplace platform  is possible.', 'In comparison to the large enterprise behind case Alpha, implementation and reaction times of  decision-making processes and accountabilities for data are less time consuming.', 'Overview

governance  as a result of an engagement inter-organizational in ecosystems.', 'It can be noted that organizations are faced  with different technical, organizational and environmental implications due to the engagement in inter- organizational  collaborations.', 'Although  the  motivation  to  initiate  data  governance  programs  differs  between the organizations, data governance appears to be relevant for all cases despite their organizational  context, domain or size.', 'The realization of the cases strongly depend on anchoring and formalizing adequate  conduct over data within the organizations, which is why the role of data governance is  regarded as  key  within each case.', 'The findings of this research demonstrate that inadequate conduct over data assets within  the organization is a major challenge as it not only hinders the adoption to data platforms, but can even  slow entry to market for the commercialization of data assets novel services.', 'With regard to R, the cases  demonstrate that it is essential for each organization to understand its “playing field” and role within data  ecosystems as the range of data governance mechanisms vary depending on the position the organization  is operating in.', 'For instance, in case Alpha and Gamma, the organizations are in control of the technical  platform infrastructure.', 'Thus, they possess more control mechanisms and can influence user interaction  and  data  management.', 'In  case  Beta,  the  organization  does  not  have  these  controls  without  owning  a  technical infrastructure for the provision of their data.', 'They are dependent and need to adopt to external  data platforms or direct customer interactions.', 'There is a bifocal perspective on the governance of platforms as organizations can embrace different roles  e.g.  platform  owner  or  platform  user.', 'Case  Alpha  (manufacturer  platform)  and  case  Gamma  (data  marketplace platform) exhibit examples of platform owners, while case Beta (selling data e.g. via platforms)  potentially engages as a platform user.', 'We argue that platform owners possess a higher level of influence  and  authority  over  data  within  the  platform.', 'Hence,  platform  owners  can  execute  various  governance  mechanisms  as  these  decisions  lie  within  a  controllable  environment  within  the  organization  as  differentiated in table 1.', 'Here, they are capable of controlling the dynamics and interactions between actors  within  the  platform.', 'In  contrast,  users  of  platforms  have  limited  authority  and  control  mechanisms.', 'Platform users as in case Beta need to consider the implications that arise from the interaction with external  platforms e.g. mandatory data standards or authoritative entry barriers (fees for platform participation).', 'Beyond the influential sphere of an organization or platform, little is known about who uses the data for  which  purpose,  and  with  whom  the  data  is  shared  subsequently  in  the  process.', 'Thus,  the  influence  of  authority for the individual actor within an ecosystem might be limited.', 'With regard to RQ 1, traditional instruments for assigning decision rights and accountabilities in terms of  how to manage data lie within the scope of the intra-organizational perspective.', 'As depicted in table 1, usual ', 'Americas Conference on Information Systems ', 'Data Governance in Data Ecosystems ', 'This organizational set-up  is anchored within the  hierarchy of the organization  and has similar characteristics to a “legislative authority”.', 'Within the intra-organizational perspective, data  governance  mostly  focuses  on  internally  produced  data  generated  by  business  processes.', 'The  presented  cases  demonstrate  that  organizations  lay  the  foundations  internally  for  successfully  engaging  in  inter- organizational  data  sharing.', 'This  includes  knowing:  which  data  is  existent  and  relevant  within  the  organization; who is responsible or can provide information related to these data assets; how the data is  used (both internally and externally) and under which conditions data can be shared with whom and where.', 'These new external aspects exceed and challenge traditional tasks and responsibilities of dedicated data  roles  within  the  intra-organizational  sphere  because  data  can  also  be  in  control  of  external  entities  as  depicted in case Alpha (machine data operated by customers).', 'Conclusion ', 'This research project is motivated by the lack of research on data governance in general, and specifically  within the domain of data ecosystems.', 'It aims at contributing to both academics and practitioners on both  domains.', 'As the role of data has changed to becoming a strategically relevant asset for many actors, we find  that  data  governance  is  an  emerging  research  topic  that  still  requires  further  analysis  within  this  new  setting.', 'The  three  practical  case  studies  investigated  under  real-life  settings  provide  valuable  practical  insights on new and diverse challenges caused by inter-organizational interactions.', 'Data managers can use  that information to derive  requirements for building  more transparency over the entire data lifecycle  or  adjust  role  descriptions  with  new  tasks  evolving  from  external  requirements.', 'As  many  businesses  are  currently  adapting  digital  strategies  and  new  business  models,  the  study  shows  that  organizations  of  all  sizes  recognize  the  necessity  of  data  governance,  yet  often  lack  the  adequate  tools  for  implementation.', 'Researchers can draw upon the practical insights and scope it within their specific domain and contribution.', 'In  light  of  existing  research,  the  scientific  contribution  of  this  paper  links  the  intra-perspective  of  an  organization  with  its  external  sphere,  a  linkage  that  has  not  been  considered  in  detail  yet.', 'Research  on  collaborative  governance  mechanisms  that  enable  co-value  creation  while  protecting  the  interests  of  all  actors is also in its infancy.', 'Recent IS researchers made great contributions to advancing the body of knowledge on data governance.', 'A  majority highlights data governance mechanisms and factors in the context of platform ecosystems (Hein  et al.', 'Schreieck et al.', 'Lee et al.', 'The research attention lies in the analysis of successful  platform  examples  derived  from  business  cases  of  digital  native  companies  like  Google  or  Facebook.', 'As  these  cases  have  a  strong  business-to-customer  focus,  they  are  limited  in  the  generalizability  for  the  representation of organizations coming from traditional domains interacting in  B2b operations as in the  analyzed  cases.', 'This  field  still  requires  further  research  as  the  skill-set  differentiates  from  digital  native  companies.', 'Existing roles specifically dedicated to data-related tasks and responsibilities require extension  in the role description as seen in Case Beta for determining the role that sets a price for data assets.', 'With  regard to limitations, this paper encompasses solely German-based organizations, which can influence the  generalizability  of  the  results.', 'Additionally,  the  data  collection  was  limited  to  the  scope  of  the  research  project.', 'As the analysis of data governance is still part of ongoing research, the authors seek to extend the  research with a wider range of firms and industries in data ecosystems.', 'Additional empirical studies can  reveal differences in geography, industry, organizational size and improve the maturity of investigation in  data governance and the effectiveness of mechanisms both internal and external.', 'We seek to draw upon the  challenges to derive

wealth of research exploring data governance, there are still some gaps in how firms  deploy data governance and what strategic actions they take to do so, especially as the volume of data increases  dramatically and the pace of data assetization accelerates.', 'To achieve this end, through an in-depth case study of  a Chinese gold mining company, namely Shandong Gold, we develop a framework to explain how firms configure  data governance activities and conduct related strategic actions.', 'Our study identifies four key data governance  activities that are supported by two strategic actions.', 'Overall, we contribute to research in data governance and  strategic action fields and also provide an alternative implementation framework for practitioners.', 'With the emergence and development of various types of technolo- gies,  previously  unimaginable  data  on  almost  all  aspects  of  business  operations  and  production,  organizational  behavior,  etc.', 'According  to  the  Statista  reports, the total amount of global data is showing exponential growth,  with  data  volumes  set  to  grow  from  33  zettabytes  in  2018  to  2,100  zettabytes in 2035 [84].', 'This has led to a constant need for companies to  think about how to derive value from the ever-increasing amount of data  [96].', 'Consequently, these data are also considered the “oil” of the digital  age [77, 91].', 'A persuasive example of this is that the Chinese govern- ment released two consecutive guidelines in 2020 that explicitly juxta- pose data with factors of production such as  land, labor, capital, and  technology, further highlighting the critical value of data as a factor [92,  93].', 'In  addition,  there  is  a  more  general  recognition  that  data  are  considered a proprietary asset of the organization [53, 67, 95].', 'Whether  it is to cope with the dramatic increase in data volumes or to turn data  into an asset, organizations need to formulate a data governance strat- egy [2].', 'Data governance is a broad concept, and current research tends to  divide  it  into  two  streams.', 'One  stream  of  research  views  data  gover- nance as the exercise of decision-making authority and control over data  (DAMA  [27])  in  order  to  transform  it  into  assets  [53,  67,  95].', 'This  stream,  therefore,  focuses  more  on  the  applicability  of  data  and  the  value attributes of data as an asset.', 'The other research stream sees data  governance as addressing data quality, privacy, and security [2, 6, 8] to ', 'Consequently, this research stream places  more emphasis on the application of data governance to data processing.', 'However, the concepts related to data governance have always been  challenging to integrate due to differences in viewpoints.', 'Based on our  understanding,  we  attempt  to  integrate  the  two  research  streams  to  conduct our work.', 'We consider data governance as the disciplined and  legitimate management of data into a strategic asset for the enterprise,  with the intervention of certain procedures, rules, and even values [2].', 'And  sound  practices  of  data  governance  can  enable  enterprises  to  transition to the digital track faster [61].', 'For example, many large en- terprises such as IBM, Google, SAP, etc.', 'These  companies  see  data  governance  as  an  important way

been  conducted  so  far  is  very  much  focused on a single action that firms undertake to deploy data gover- nance,  which  tends  to  emerge  in  a  fragmented  manner.', 'However,  to  benefit from various data (successful deployment of data governance),  companies typically need to develop tangible and intangible resources  (implement strategic actions), such as technology, collaboration, lead- ership,  corporate  culture,  etc.', 'Therefore, to deepen the understanding of strategic actions to advance  data governance, we hope to provide a relatively well-developed stra- tegic action framework to explain the key processes of enterprise data  governance  deployment.', 'Hence,  the  second  research  question  is  a  further  explanation  of  what  strategic  actions  play  a  crucial  role  in  explaining this importance and how they are sustained.', 'Given  the  limited  and  vague  theoretical  insights,  we  address  the  above questions and lacunae by examining a single case in depth [30,  31, 80].', 'We reviewed the practice of data governance at Shandong Gold  (hereafter referred to as Gold).', 'As a gold mining company in China, Gold  put forward the strategic goal of building digital mines in 2007 and, in  addition,  international  first-rate  model mines  in  2017, placing  digital  mine and data governance at the core.', 'After a series of activities and  changes, Gold has become a leading global mining company [21].', 'To  present  our  case,  we  have  assembled  our  database  using  interviews,  media and press coverage, industry reports, internal documents, and so  on.', 'Our findings inform a deeper understanding of the configuration of  data  governance  and,  in  addition,  contribute  to  data  governance  and  strategic action fields by developing a framework.', 'Firstly, we provide  four  aspects  of  deployment  based  on  an  integrated  concept  of  data  governance,  i.e.,  data  collaboration,  perceptions  of  data  potential,  developing capabilities, and the establishment of data legitimacy.', 'Sec- ondly,  by  detecting  strategic  actions  undertaken  to  configure  data  governance activities, i.e., investment in digital technologies and design  of governance mechanisms, we promote research at the intersection of  strategic  action  fields  and  data  governance.', 'Finally,  we  enrich  the  research  on  the  consequences  of  data  governance  by  proposing  a  concept of data legitimacy.', 'Theoretical background ', 'Why data governance matters ', 'As  digital  transformation  is  becoming  an  important  way  for  com- panies  to  gain  new  growth  advantages,  data  has  become  an  essential  strategic resource for companies [9, 15, 40].', 'To this end, many firms  have  created  dedicated  departments or  teams  around  data  collection,  analysis, and integration [96] to coordinate all aspects of data gover- nance, innovation, and strategy implementation [43, 66, 83, 99], as well  as to deal with the increasing pressure on data [74, 101].', 'It is worth  noting that China has identified data as another factor of production in  addition to land, labor, capital, and technology [92, 93].', 'This shows that  national  policy,  management  practice,  and  theoretical  research  have  begun to pay much attention to data governance [2].', 'The growing  importance  of data  governance is a  concept  that has  developed  over  the  past  decade  and  is  gradually  gaining  widespread  scholarly  attention  (e.g.,  [2]).', 'One  research  stream  considers  data ', 'DAMA [27]) in order to treat data as an important and valuable asset  [53, 67, 95].', 'Its purpose is to implement data-driven and rapid opera- tional and strategic decisions for company-wide processes [89].', 'There- fore, data governance has become an important way for companies to  build new assets and gain unique competitive advantages [96].', 'Some projections indicate that the total amount of global data will  grow  exponentially  from  33  zettabytes  in  2018  to  more  than  2,100  zettabytes in 2035 [84].', 'However, data is everywhere, and companies  are using multiple channels to collect data widely and quickly [2, 48],  which  makes  data  inconsistent,  severely  affecting  data  quality  and  consequently creating problems with data management risks [85].', 'More  seriously, these risks create distrust in data among business managers  and  decision-makers  [74]  and  consequently  increase  the  cost  of  data  collection  and  analysis  [82,  83].', 'This  gives  rise  to  another  research  stream that considers data governance as the activity of controlling data  quality and preventing data risks [2, 6, 8].', 'In this study, integrating the two research streams mentioned above,  we consider data governance as the standardized management of data with  legitimacy to transform it into a strategic asset for the enterprise, with the  intervention of certain procedures, rules, and even values (e.g., [2]).', 'Our  definition specifies four important attributes for deploying data gover- nance  activities.', 'In  terms  of  concepts,  data  governance,  as  a  strategic  function within the organizational structure, falls under the umbrella of  corporate governance [98] and encompasses the activities undertaken to  create and execute this function [48].', 'As such, it inherently encompasses  the subject and object of governance: who can make decisions about the  use, sharing, etc.', 'Data governance  is  thus  the  application of different degrees by subject and object participants and  can be decided jointly by the actors involved in this activity [76, 96].', 'Mechanistically, to guarantee the proper data governance process, com- panies  usually  design  a  series  of  mechanisms  to  ensure  the  smooth  implementation of strategic actions related to data governance.', 'These  mechanisms include structures that connect data to the business, pro- cedures, and norms for deploying data governance [2, 7, 52, 95], and  relationships  that  support  participants  in  developing  governance  col- laborations, which together form part of data governance [2].', 'In terms  of  consequences,  deploying  data  governance  around  high-quality  data  ensures that firms build resilient organizations that can quickly adapt to  business  disruptions  [88]  while  building  connections  with  various  governance  participants  to  jointly  develop  new  solutions  for  future  business  growth  [11].', 'Thus,  companies  can  build  legitimacy  around  data regulation, data pragmatism, data-related values, and data cogni- tion in their data governance activities [33].', 'In fact, firms in practice, often face problems with the identification  and  collection  of  valuable  data  [48]  as  well  as  analysis  and  trans- formation (Morabito, 2015; [100])—the “first mile” and “last mile” of  data  issues.', 'For  the  former,  companies  overcome  difficulties  in  data  identification  and  collection  by  establishing  formal  structures  that  connect “business, IT, and data management functions” (the “first mile”  problem) ([2], p.', 'These formal structures describe the roles and  responsibilities involved in data governance, as well as the filtering and  monitoring of data ([2]; DAMA [27]).', 'For example, companies specify  guidelines  and  rules  for  the  creation,  acquisition,  storage,  security,  quality, and permitted use of data (DAMA [27, 87, 95]) by developing  standard processes and policies for data and by establishing employee  organizations that support dedicated data governance activities (DAMA  [27]).', 'The “last mile” problem—how to turn data into an asset and guide  business operations and decisions (data analysis and transformation)—is  more likely to leave organizations in a data governance quandary.', 'To  this  end,  organizations  often  develop  different  data  governance  sce- narios  around  the  business  and  develop  clear  data  analysis  processes  [62] by building specialized collaborations [7], such as increased prof- itability and cost savings, and even social acceptance [89].', 'There is no  doubt that existing research has made significant attempts to address the ', 'Information&Managemen(2022)1036422\\x0cQ.', 'Zhang et al.', 'But not all these problems can be  solved  by  the  rules  and  procedures  established  by  companies.', 'For  example,  when  companies  lack  experience  in  data  governance,  cross-organizational collaboration may be an effective way to address  data  silos [2];  when companies gain  experience, they may be able  to  effectively address the risks of data regulation and develop deeper data  awareness by establishing legitimacy [33].', 'Strategic actions for data governance ', 'As  data governance  focuses  on  data as  a  strategic  asset of  the  en- terprise [53, 67–69] and requires the design of standards and processes  in line with the objectives of deploying data governance [2, 7, 52, 95], it  all needs to be aligned with the organization’s strategy [2] and a series  of actions around the achievement of the process [11, 26].', 'The mechanisms involved in data governance indicate that this is a  collective  action  involving  many  participants.', 'Companies  need  to  consider  the  data  lifecycle  as  they  move  forward  with  various  gover- nance initiatives [28, 89].', 'Strategic actions—concrete actions that form  data  collaboration  across  departments  and  organizations  in  the  common  pursuit of data governance efficiency [96]—can illustrate the viability of  data  and  its  potential  for  future  growth  and  application.', 'In  line  with  previous research, strategic actions are considered in this study when  they are perceived as influential by actors responsible for the organi- zation’s  perspective  and  overall  direction,  survival,  and  competitive  position [81].', 'There is no doubt that deploying and coordinating stra- tegic actions is the preserve of business managers or executives [34].', 'Still,  it  requires  the  complement  of  many  participants—often  across  hierarchies—to drive collective action [94].', 'Successful strategic actions  can lead to disruptive or stable results, or they can create a shared un- derstanding and consensus among initiators and implementers for spe- cific fields of activity [22].', 'Governance mechanisms refer to establishing standards and uniform  rules, values, procedures, etc.', 'Many studies have shown that the successful  deployment  of  data  governance  needs  to  be  secured  by  governance  mechanisms that provide an operational environment for the actors [2,  48].', 'In  some  cases,  actors’  goals  may  be  ambiguous,  making  the  outcome  of  data  governance  unpredictable  [11],  and  designing  a  governance mechanism that can span the data lifecycle can effectively  circumvent these problems.', 'On the other hand, we also need to confront  the  issue  of  opportunism  in  data  governance.', 'In  the  implementation  process, individuals may try to maximize their own interests or those of  their organizations, but this inevitably undermines the overall interests  of  the  enterprise  or  the  alliance  [11, 58],  which  creates  incentive  in- compatibility.', 'In  collective  action  theory,  however,  solving  similar  paradoxical problems requires governance mechanisms to influence and  intervene in members’ actions and produce a favorable, joint outcome  [46].', 'Furthermore, datafication related technologies enable companies to  access,  analyze,  and  share  data  at  a  lower  cost  [71].', 'These  digital  technologies  are  deeply  embedded  in  an  organization’s  products  and  services and rely on the central role in developing and initiating data  governance [38].', 'The role of technology for the enterprise has thus risen  from functional to a strategic level.', 'Indeed, data governance in enter- prises can be seen as a set of corporate governance activities around data  supported  by  various  technologies  [25,  98].', 'Moreover,  the  design  of  platform-related  technologies  can  provide  complex  interactions  be- tween multiple parties using or sharing data, thus enhancing data gov- ernance’s efficiency and eliminating data privacy hazards [56, 96].', 'While existing research provides good insights into data governance,  the difficulty of understanding and capturing the value of data and data  governance activities has made it a constant challenge [11].', 'Moreover,  because of the wide range of actors involved in data governance, how to  coordinate the behavior of these actors has also been an area where the  existing literature has tried to understand and breakthrough.', 'Research methodology ', 'Research design ', 'To  gain  more  exploratory  insights,  we  use  the  longitudinal  single  case study to increase our understanding of complex social and mana- gerial  phenomena  [31],  common  in  current  research  (e.g.,  [13,  51]).', 'Here, it is the deployment of data governance and the implementation of  strategic actions.', 'The single case study supports intensive research and  allows for a rich discourse on the case [13, 45].', 'The use of multiple data  sources allows for a comprehensive induction of the activities, objects,  etc.', 'Furthermore, the company we  focus on—Gold—can reflect the criteria of the polar case [105], which  can lead us to more disruptive insights.', 'More to the point, the objective  of this study is to explore how companies deploy data governance and  how it triggers strategic actions in companies.', 'Therefore, the problem of  “how” and the process perspective are more suitable for case studies [30,  31].', 'Overall, we answer our research questions and pry the theory for- ward by analyzing a case in depth [80].', 'Research setting and case selection ', 'Several interrelated motivations drove our focus on, and interest in  Gold: in addition to the criteria for polarity case, the selection of Gold  involved  theoretical  sampling  [30,  31,  105]—firms  had  to  meet  our  theoretical expectations and be able to generate theoretical questions or  phenomena that sparked interest [10], and the availability of rich data  was also a must for the longitudinal case study.', 'First,  we  selected  China’s  gold  mining  industry  as  our  research  setting not only because China is a global leader in gold production (it  has been the largest gold producer for 11 years in succession since 2007  when it first overtook South Africa in gold production) [39], but also  because  the  Chinese  gold  mining  industry  has  been  driving  digital  transformation for many years now.', 'The path and significant events of  the digital transformation are clear.', 'More importantly, data shows that  profits from mining businesses can be increased by 20-45% in 2-3 years  through  digital  technologies,  which  has  led  more  and  more  mining  companies to invest in digital transformation [50].', 'We identified a series  of  notable  events  [80]  involving  a  gold  mining  company,  i.e.,  Gold  which  started  its  digital  transformation  in  2007.', 'Moreover,  Gold  has  partnered  with  Huawei  to  co-develop  the  first  big  data  platform  for  metal mines in China and is also the first mining company in China to be  applying 5G communication technology.', 'Second,  in  August  2017,  Gold  established  the  strategic  goal  of  building  an  international  first-rate  model  mine,  incorporating  digital  transformation  and  data  governance  into  the  strategic  framework.', 'Moreover, In January 2021, a gold mine explosion disaster occurred in  Yantai, Shandong Province, China, due to the illegal use of explosives for  civil purposes [103].', 'Although this was not a Gold-owned mine, it was  still forced to shut down for screening.', 'In the interview, an informant  revealed that “if it had been fully digitalized, this accident might not have  happened ()”.', 'Besides, the materials we collected show that Gold has  made  outstanding  achievements  in  data  governance  that  meet  our  theoretical  expectations.', 'For  example,  Gold  has  won  many  relevant  awards  at  the  provincial  and  national  levels  after  carrying  out  data  governance and has participated in the preparation of the “Guide to the  Construction of Intelligent Mines for Non-ferrous Metals” hosted by the  Chinese government.', 'Finally, as members of Gold’s project team, the authors of this study

abductive  approach  resulting  from  the  interplay  between  existing  theoretical  frameworks, emerging theories, and data [14, 59].', 'This means that we  developed new theoretical insights by coding, aggregating, and linking  categories  to  emerging  theories  and  reflecting  them  in  existing  theo- retical frameworks for ongoing abstraction from the raw data [24, 59].', 'We followed the three data analysis steps in the literature [36].', 'The  first step is the organization of the raw data.', 'In concrete terms, we read  all the data carefully, looking for items, key events, or themes in the raw  data,  then  marking  them  and  giving  them  an  initial  label.', 'Existing  concepts  or  theories  do  not  influence  this  label;  instead,  it  is  derived  from keywords or sentences in the data.', 'After our labeling process, they  were transformed into first-order concepts for this study and distributed  according to different categories.', 'The second step of the data analysis is the organization of the first-  order  concepts.', 'Based  on  the  existing  labels  and  categories,  we  per- formed iterative tests of their boundary strengths to investigate the links  between the existing categories, thus forming the second-order themes  of this study.', 'In this step, we iterated on the data.', 'The authors of this  work  acted  as  the  primary  person  for  code  abstraction  and  thematic  analysis.', 'Other researchers in the research team acted as “outsiders” [32,  65].', 'At this stage, where the authors and outsiders question each other  whether  these  abstract  themes  can  reflect  new  phenomena  [36]  and  whether  theoretical  saturation  has  been  reached  [19].', 'Then,  we  can  judge that theoretical saturation has been reached when it is determined  that no new concepts have emerged and that these themes can cover the  new phenomena shown by the case [19].', 'Third, we started searching theoretical and research fields, such as  big data collaboration mentioned by van den Broek & van Veenstra [96],  Ferreira et al.’s (2021) research on the legitimacy of big data, and so on.', 'Then  we  use  these  datasets  to  connect

this paper, data collaboration refers to a way of  organization in which companies form cross-  departmental staff organizations internally and  collaborative teams with external partners around  data governance.', 'In this paper, activating the perception of data potential  is an intervention by companies to increase  employees’ awareness of data and perception of its  value with the help of executive guidance, data-  related corporate culture, etc.', 'In this paper, developing data-related capabilities  means that companies develop specialized  capabilities related to data collection, processing,  integration, and analysis at the individual and  organizational levels with the help of skills training  and collaboration.', 'In this paper, the establishment of data legitimacy  refers to gain and the extent to which the data  governance activities deployed by the enterprise are  recognized by society.', 'Deploying data governance in the enterprise ', 'Laying the groundwork through internal and external data  collaboration ', 'The first important aspect of data governance that we investigate is  data collaboration, manifested through Gold’s interactions with internal  staff and external stakeholders.', 'Gold’s employees and partners indicated  that  data  governance  is  a  huge  undertaking  that  requires  specialized  knowledge and skills, which often “needs to be acquired through collabo- ration ()”.', 'Hence, in two ways, data collaboration lays the founda- tion for data governance.', 'Firstly, as a traditional mining company, Gold  does  not  have  many  highly  skilled  personnel  working  in  information  technology, big data, etc., so “we have to work with specialized companies  to  develop  data-related  infrastructures  ()”.', 'For  example,  in  order  to  build  a  data  cloud  platform  and  ERP  (enterprise  resource  planning),  Gold  cooperated  with  Huawei,  SAP,  and  other  companies.', 'With  the  assistance  of  Huawei,  Sanshan  Island  Gold  Mine  has  realized  an  internal  unified  standard  data  lake;  a  unified  big  data  platform  for  the  collection,  storage, calculation, analysis, and application has been formed based on the  construction of the data lake (Internal documents)”.', 'To do this, Gold can  make up for its own resource disadvantage and thus rely on specialized  external knowledge to break through the bottleneck in the field of data  management.', 'As  Huawei’s  IT  product  manager  said  about  this  cooperation, ', 'It is very challenging work, but also a mutual achievement.', 'Through  such cooperation, we can prove that it is feasible for us to build a  cloud  platform  in  the  mining  industry  and  show  Gold’s  trust  in  Huawei ().', 'Gold provides the vehicle and support for deploying data governance  with external collaborations, which preserves and optimizes established  resource investments based on a blend of traditional and digital tech- nology architectures.', 'Moreover, by converging external digital services,  companies  can develop  long-term data  collaboration  with  partners  to  complement more advanced services in the future (e.g., [11]).', 'The in- formants reported the following: ', 'Through the big data platform and ERP, we have brought together  data from various mine areas, such as production, human resources,  finance, and materials, and eliminated barriers to business systems.', 'A total of more than 100,000 pieces of data from the entire mine are ', 'There is no doubt that this cooperation is crucial and that there is no  way for a single company to complete such a large project.', 'One of the  biggest benefits of doing this is that we don’t have to do things we are  not good at ().', 'Second, greater intra-enterprise collaboration allows for rapid inte- gration of data resources and inter-organizational learning to share in- vestments,  increases  the  number  of  data  sets  within  an  organization  [96], and deconstructs data silos [2].', 'This leads directly to more stan- dard and efficient data collection and transformation protocols as well as  data  exchange  and  reporting  mechanisms  [68].', 'On  the  one  hand,  in  order to proliferate the benefits of the big data platform, Gold consoli- dated the various mines under its authority to establish mine divisions to  keep data consistent and standardized across the organization.', 'On the  other hand, due to the interaction of the mine divisions on the big data  platform, Gold’s employees can consult to gain consistent insights on  data discipline and share data governance experiences on an ongoing  basis,  thereby  enhancing  cross-organizational  and  departmental  learning.', 'Another informant explains, ', 'Data governance is an important cross-organizational effort, and as a  conglomerate, it is difficult to establish data norms without adequate  collaboration  between  companies  across  the  country.', 'And  these  standards  on  data  can’t  be  determined  by  just  a  few  people;  they  need to involve employees in a way that makes them comfortable  ().', 'Data  collaboration,  as  we  have  explained  here,  is  considered  the  foundation  of  data  governance,  which  provides  a  collaborative  envi- ronment  for  internal  and  external  actors  to  work  together  on  data  standards or guidelines.', 'Activating the perception of data potential ', 'The second data governance focus we offer is to build the perception  of the potential of data.', 'It suggests that deploying data governance on a  large scale, at least across the enterprise, requires a sense of the potential  of data in guiding business operations and process transformation.', 'The  informant noted that “The whole society cares about these things, and there  is an increased awareness from this project and the perception of personnel.', 'There is no problem with this path being taken and technical path, coupled  with the acceptance of the entire workforce ()”.', 'However, Gold believes  that developing a positive perception of the potential of data within an  organization is not easy because “everyone has different cognitive bound- aries, so their awareness of things is wildly different ()”.', 'To achieve that  end, Gold focused on two aspects to build and strengthen personnel’s  perceptions of data potential.', 'First, in this study, we consider executives’ insights and initiatives as  an important step in enabling personnel to generate perceptions of data  potential.', 'On the one hand, as a gold mining company that started to  focus on digital transformation earlier in China, Gold started a project of  digital mine construction in 2007, gradually guiding employees to un- derstand  and  accept  the  new  strategic  environment.', 'One  informant  praised their leadership in digital mines, “Vision of leaders is important  [...] Most people can only see the skin-deep, a few can have insight ()”.', 'On the other hand, to show the attitude, everyone from the chairman to  the CIO to the division president expressed a high level of interest in data  and digitization and showed their determination to deploy data gover- nance  while  releasing  a  series  of  initiatives.', 'This  shows  that  data  governance is mainly driven by top management at Gold, and managers  have explicitly made data governance a strategic decision for the com- pany on several occasions (internal meetings, public speeches, etc.).', 'As  the chairman emphasized in an interview, ', 'It has to be the responsibility of managers.', 'If managers ignore it, then  no one will care about it [...] While some highly qualified employees ', 'Information&Managemen(2022)1036426\\x0cQ.', 'Zhang et al.', 'Second, in Gold’s case, we observed that the company had developed  and promoted a digitally relevant organization culture to successfully  deploy  data  governance  and  promote  the  strategic  use  of  data  and  business vision.', 'The purpose of this organization culture was “to develop  a strategic vision among employees ()”.', 'As a collective action [11], the  company needs to consider the level of acceptance by all members.', 'The  informant explained to us the importance of organizational culture in  activating and raising the awareness of personnel, ', 'Organizational culture is the universal key, it exists anywhere, and it  can  work  anywhere.', 'I  think  the  role  of  culture  is  essential  to  get  employees to realize that data turns out to be so powerful […].', 'It  [Culture] can’t directly provide anything material to employees, but  it  [culture]  can  subconsciously  lead  employees  to  recognize  and  believe in something ().', 'Our  data  also  shows  that  Gold  has  set  out  the  goal  of  creating  a  pioneering  company  in  the  digital  transformation  of  the  global  gold  mining industry, with specific implementation plans around technology,  resources, organization, capabilities, and operations.', 'With the influence  of the organizational culture, “employees can accelerate their awareness of  data governance ()”.', 'These goals and programs make employees aware  of the importance of data in the business and drive them to engage more  diligently in data governance activities.', 'Developing data-related capabilities ', 'The  third  focus  of  data  governance,  which  we  dissected,  is  devel- oping capabilities.', 'These capabilities are primarily related to organiza- tional  and  individual  levels,  are  related  to  data,  and  are  organized  around governance activities.', 'These capabilities are critical since they  guarantee the micro-foundation  for Gold to achieve data governance,  “yet the capabilities are inconsistent across departments, people, and orga- nizations at all levels ()”.', 'Therefore, Gold can quickly coordinate be- haviors at all levels by developing data-related capabilities, accelerating  the transformation of data into critical assets, and leveraging these as- sets  to  serve  the  various  application  scenarios  in  the  mine.', 'As  the  informant  mentioned,  “Digital  transformation  enhances  the  capability  to  process data [...].', 'With the help of data assets some capabilities or common  assets that can be shared in common can be distilled ()”.', 'To this end, Gold  has developed data-related capabilities in three areas.', 'Firstly, “Many of the company’s employees are older […].', 'They don’t  even have a bachelor’s degree ()”, so Gold had to set up a professional  training  department  to  sharpen  the  personnel’s  capabilities.', 'As  we  observed and learned while attending internal meetings, the department  exists  to  train  employees  around  data  infrastructure  (e.g.,  technical  systems  that  integrate  IT,  operating  protocols  for  big  data  platforms,  etc.)  to  “make  sure  they  have  the  ability  to  operate  advanced  equipment  ()”.', 'This department also has the responsibility of “communicating  and  sharing  experiences  across  units  and  organizations  (Internal  docu- ments)”, and the informants explained its importance to us, ', 'This  department  is  mainly  responsible  for  lecturing  and  skills  training [...] We often experience this [...] It gives employees a place  to share knowledge, reach out to employees in other departments,  and,  most  critically,  promote  collective  knowledge  creation  [...]  They need such a place to improve themselves ().', 'Secondly, Gold has integrated most of the business and operational  data about the mine into the big data platform.', 'This is an important step  in developing data assets ()”.', 'With Huawei’s help, Gold used the big  data platform to achieve interoperability of semantics, “solving the situ- ation  where  semantics  were  not  interoperable  between  different  business  systems ()”.', 'One significant way is that Gold integrated and trans- formed the various industrial protocols of the mine and interfaced them ', 'IT system of the big data platform to implement the collection  of data from multiple businesses.', 'Further, the collected data was clari- fied according to the data rules and standards set in advance by the big  data platform to obtain high-quality data with decision value and service  attributes.', 'As the informants noted, ', 'When  we  subsume  the  business  to  the  big  data  platform,  we  also  realize the company’s digitization.', 'But after we really capture the  data, we can’t use it directly because it is actually messy and disor- dered data.', 'We need to govern the data in accordance with the data  standards to get clean and practical data.', 'We call this process data  assetization ().', 'Thirdly,  to  maximize  the  use  of  data  assets,  Gold  has  developed  relevant  data  services  for  various  scenarios.', 'The  mines  under  Gold’s  jurisdiction are located all over China, and “while establishing common  data standards and rules can help ensure consistent data management and  governance, it is a tough task to apply them across the mines in the country  ()”.', 'Due to the varying degree of digitization across mines, Gold has  to take a point-by-point approach to advance gradually.', 'Therefore, Gold  has developed many shared capabilities and services, i.e., sorted out the  corresponding service catalog, “so that we can directly invoke existing data  when developing new businesses in the future ()”.', 'Moreover, the infor- mant reports that these shared capabilities and services can be applied to  other gold mines as well.', 'With this big data platform, we have achieved another such capa- bility [...] Why would we want to develop such services and appli- cations?', 'Our platform has this kind of flexible development of such a  capability, can be integrated into these services and applications on  our  platform,  so  the  future  is  through  this  kind  of  service  way  to  quickly develop the corresponding application out ().', 'Establishing data legitimacy ', 'The fourth important element of data governance that we considered  is establishing data legitimacy.', 'The data we have observed suggests that  Gold focuses on the legitimacy identity associated with data as it deploys  data governance.', 'One informant explained to us the importance of this  legitimacy, “In fact, we are very keen to have the recognition of the com- munity and the state, not just to encourage us, but more importantly, we need  to be clear about whether this is the right thing to do ()”.', 'To establish  data legitimacy and maintain it in the long term, Gold has made efforts  in three areas.', 'Firstly, since starting its digital mine construction strategy in 2007,  Gold has received several national patents, awards, and projects related  to data governance.', 'Gold, for example, won the first prize for enterprise  technology innovation in Shandong Province on the project of research  and  application  of  data  standards  in  the  mining  industry.', 'A  series  of  patents, awards, and projects have enabled Gold to gain national and  social recognition and the opportunity to participate in the “preparation  of the “Guide to the Construction of Intelligent Mines for Non-ferrous  Metals”  hosted by the Chinese government (Web archive)”.', 'As one of  the interviewees pointed out, ', 'This proves that our data governance solution works […] The state  recognizes our contribution to data governance, which is the most  delightful thing for us.', 'With the support of the state, we are confident  to support the development of relevant data or industry standards  ().', 'Secondly, our data also shows that Gold is actively involved in efforts  to formulate data standards for the mining industry.', 'Mining is a very  special industry.', 'Almost all the data comes from mines, but different types of  mines and companies will have various standards for data collection, pro- cessing, and analysis ()”, said one informant.', 'Therefore, what Gold  really wants to do is to establish a common data integration scheme,  interface standard and data coding scheme for the whole industry.', 'In ', 'Information&Managemen(2022)1036427\\x0cQ.', 'Zhang et al.', 'Gold  established  an  identity  of  data  legitimacy  within  the  mining industry and, in addition, became a member of the World Gold  Council in 2018.', 'One interviewee recalled excitedly, “This is the recog- nition of us by a worldwide organization ()”.', 'Thirdly, Gold has launched the strategy of “international first-rate  model  mine”  since  2017,  with  data  governance  as  one  of  the  critical  elements of the strategy.', 'It has integrated existing data assets and car- ried  out  data  governance  work  on  six  themes:  geology,  production,  safety,  equipment,  human  resources,  and  finance.', 'The  company’s  in- ternal  documents  explain  the  importance  of  data  governance  in  the  implementation of this strategy, ', 'The existing business data of each mine is connected, and a high-  quality  and  high-standard  data  lake  of  the  enterprise  is  formed  through  data  governance.', 'The  data  lake  brings  together  the  core  business data of the enterprise and forms valuable data assets (In- ternal documents).', 'In addition, it is worth mentioning that according to data reported by  Metals Focus UK, Gold is in the top 10 in global gold production for the  second year in a row (2019 and 2020), despite the disruptions caused by  COVID-19  and  the  forced  shutdown  caused  by  the  Yantai  gold  mine  disaster  [21].', 'One  interviewee  said  excitedly,  “Data  contributed  to  it;  that’s the power of data ()”.', 'Strategic actions for the deployment of data governance ', 'We then continued our discussion of the strategic actions that Gold  has  taken  to  deploy  data  governance.', 'These  can  be  reflected  in  two  areas: 1) investment in digital technologies and 2) design of governance  mechanisms.', 'Investment in digital technologies ', 'The first type of strategic action we observed to deploy data gover- nance was the investment in digital technologies that mean Gold can  provide  new  application  scenarios  and  infrastructure  for  data  gover- nance (e.g., [104]), thereby conceptualizing governance activities as a  collective strategic action (e.g., [11, 22]).', 'Technology development and  investment are necessary to carry out our data governance activities ()”.', 'From the informant’s report, we can analyze that investment in tech- nology is a strategic action necessary to guarantee the deployment of  data governance in the enterprise because “digital technology provides the  operational  environment  for  data  collection,  storage,  and  analysis  so  that  data governance can follow standard technical specifications ()”.', 'Gold’s  investment  is  reflected  in  three  main  areas.', 'Firstly,  as  mentioned  earlier,  Gold  is  a  labor-intensive  state-owned  enterprise  (SOE) dominated by traditional technology, so “technological revolution is  essential  to  ensure  that  we  can  move  forward  with  data  governance  and  digital transformation ()”.', 'To this end, Gold has invested over RMB  200 million in developing and introducing new digital technologies and  equipment.', 'Gold, for example, has introduced “3D mining software and  laser scanning equipment at its Sanshan Island Gold Mine to establish a full  lifecycle data management system for the mine (Implementation plan)”.', 'Secondly,  Gold  has  developed  a  big  data  platform,  production  technology  collaboration  platform,  ERP,  etc.,  around  business  opera- tions and mining with the cooperation of external partners.', 'The plat- form  is  the  infrastructure  for  deploying  data  governance  ()”.', 'These  platforms  have  different  technical  modules  designed  by  various  part- ners.', 'As  a  result,  a  decentralized  coupling  between  these  technology  modules is formed around the core goal of data governance and drives  Gold and partners to build consensus around strategic actions.', 'As one  interviewee of BGRIMM mentioned, ', 'Our  new  technologies  such  as  artificial  intelligence,  industrial  internet, and 5G are developing rapidly.', 'These technologies can be  combined with our mining industry faster, which can empower the  data governance of enterprises.', 'These technologies can precipitate ', 'Thirdly, Gold has embedded various remote monitoring sensors in  the  central  part  of  the  mine  and  associated  mechanical equipment  to  integrate the data into the platforms.', 'Usage data on installed equipment  provided  by  these  sensors  was  identified  as  the  essential  strategic  resource  [42].', 'Our  informants  report  that  these  sensors  have  the  following  indicated  conveniences  and  benefits:  1)  they  can  be  imple- mented to monitor the condition of the mine and equipment and then  “reduce production losses due to downtime ()” and 2) the data provided  by  the  sensors  is  a  key  strategic  resource  for  the  company  and  an  important element of governance activities.', 'Design of governance mechanisms ', 'As described above, companies have developed a series of mecha- nisms  around  data  governance  structures  or  elements,  data  processes  and norms, and collaborative relationships among participating parties,  which together guarantee the proper process of data governance [2, 7,  52, 95].', 'Moreover, designing governance mechanisms allows different  participating subjects to reach a consensus around a core purpose and  form  a  consistent  value  proposition,  i.e.,  to  deploy  data  governance  together.', 'To  this  end,  Gold  designed  governance  mechanisms  in  two  ways.', 'Firstly, we argue that necessary strategic action is to establish the  relationship  mechanism  in  this  study,  which  can  strengthen  stake- holders’ awareness of data governance planning, knowledge, skills, and  processes  through  inter-  and  intra-organizational  communication,  co- ordination,  and  mutual  benefit  [41,  96],  thereby  building  shared  commitment  [2].', 'To  this  end,  Gold  has  established  the  relationship  mechanism in two ways.', 'On  the  one  hand,  Gold  has  established  partnerships  with  external  participants to develop digital technologies around data infrastructure  jointly according to different technology modules.', 'These project teams  comprise employees from different units, departments, and even com- panies who “exist because of a specific business or activity ()”.', 'On the  other hand, Gold has refined the relationship mechanism by establishing  fast  and  efficient  communication  and  coordination  channels.', 'One  informant  explained  the  importance  of  communication  as  a  critical  element of the relationship mechanism, “Communication identifies issues  in a timely manner [...] It can ensure that the knowledge and skills of data  governance flow within the team ()”.', 'Subsequently, another interviewee  stated that “coordination is also important ()”.', 'This is because coordi- nation gives the project team the ability to make decisions without being  subject  to  the  strict  hierarchy  of  centralized  decision-making.', 'As  one  business unit manager pointed out, ', 'The purpose of coordination is to facilitate collaboration.', 'We need to  take  advantage  of  the  resources  of  other  companies  to  help  us  accelerate  the  process  [...]  Many  people  are  unaware  of  the  data  governance  process,  even  managers.', 'In  this  case,  if  they  [project  teams] are not allowed to work flexibly, the process will be very slow  ().', 'Secondly, another of Gold’s practices that we observed in service of  relationship mechanism building was the establishment of a supportive  organizational structure.', 'As this first-order concept suggests, “we with- stood all the pressure to overhaul the organization structure ()” to support  the data governance efforts.', 'However, as an SOE, Gold could not afford  to  build  a  completely  flat  organization  like  Internet  companies.', 'The  enterprise,  therefore,  had  multiple  decentralized  governance  unit  or- ganizations embedded in the original large hierarchical structure.', 'One  informant explained to us the benefits of doing so, ', 'Such a structure is the best fit.', 'Managers are able to retain all deci- sion  and  control  rights  at  the  group  level,  with  a  unified  and ', 'Information&Managemen(2022)1036428\\x0cQ.', 'Zhang et al.', 'In  turn,  these  unit  organizations  can  coordinate  and  make  decisions  around  the  specific  activities  included  in  data  governance ().', 'From this, it can be seen that Gold uses a semi-decentralized orga- nization  structure  to  strengthen  the  relationship  mechanism  among  employees.', 'On this basis, Gold’s teams and organizations can establish a  reciprocal data governance identity, thus resolving the conflict between  centralization  and  decentralization  and  giving  data  governance  the  property  of  participation  by  all  members.', 'As  one  informant  who  has  been  involved  in  organization  change  and  data  governance  efforts  stated, ', 'We started in 2017; fortunately, with these years of transformation  [...] whether it is digital technology or digital transformation, it is  supported by data, and the key here is the support of the organiza- tion.', 'Organizational change is important ().', 'A strategic action framework for data governance ', 'In  this  qualitative  study,  we  systematically  analyze  how  Gold  de- ploys data governance and the strategic activities  undertaken for this  purpose,  which  guarantee  its  successful  implementation.', 'In  order  to  explain the process of enterprise data governance and the strategic ac- tions carried out, as a result, we drew the analytical framework shown in  Fig.', 'In Fig.', 'From the era of the industrial revolution to the digital age, the stock  of data is growing exponentially [3, 60]; the cost of acquisition, storage,  analysis, and sharing of data has decreased dramatically [60, 96]; the  increasing  importance  of  data  and  its  analysis  has  led  to  dramatic  changes  in  management  and  production  activities  and  boundaries  within the enterprise [62].', 'These changes have triggered a serious new  phenomenon—companies  are  beginning  to  pay  more  attention  to  the  asset-based  attributes  of  data  in  their  operations  and  are  making  sig- nificant investments around it.', 'Because of this, enterprises have had to  invest in deploying and promoting data governance efforts within and  outside  the  enterprise  to  collect  and  use  trustworthy,  big,  and  open  linked data [29, 48].', 'The process of deploying data governance ', 'Most  enterprises  are  constrained  by  industry  boundaries  (e.g.,  decoupling from big data technologies, the cost of digital transition, etc.)  and do not have the ability to work independently on data governance.', 'Therefore,  they  can  only  seek  internal  and  external  cooperation,  i.e.,  data  collaboration,  around  adopting  datafication  technologies,  data  analysis,  application,  etc.', 'Suppose  collaboration  is  rejected  between  different departments, organizations, or even enterprises, the company  cannot develop and implement effective data governance principles to  the extent that the company cannot effectively share data in a valuable  way  [11].', 'Therefore,  it  is  understandable  why  data  governance  has  become  a  collective  action  [11]  that encompasses  subject companies,  employees,  partners,  government  regulators,  and  even  rivals  [22].', 'Different actors play different roles; they collaborate and contribute to  data governance, thus driving a great leap forward in the data gover- nance process.', 'In this study, data governance as a collective action is  reflected in: (1) collaboration between Gold and external players such as  Huawei and BGRIMM to develop data infrastructure; (2) collaboration  between  different  business  units  within  the  enterprise  to  share  data  governance  experience;  (3)  collaboration  between  executives  and  employees—to some extent, executives and employees can be consid- ered as a partnership—to activate perceptions of data potential; and (4)  collaboration  between  the  enterprise  and  government  regulators  to  advance the standardization of data governance experiences.', 'This means  that  the  practical  solution  of  a  complex  problem  depends  to  a  large  extent on the interdependence between multiple actors, i.e., collective  action [58, 75].', 'This relationship is based on collaborative governance  and data sharing [76, 96], with data governance as the ultimate goal of  achievement [2].', 'It follows that data collaboration is  the first step in  data governance arrangement for traditional companies, which not only  provides the firm with opportunities to leverage external resources and  strengths but also provides the infrastructure necessary for the firm to  carry out this work.', 'While data collaboration allows organizations to take the first step  toward data governance, the perceptions of the data potential within the  organization and the capabilities developed to orchestrate these activities  determine how far that step is.', 'Data-related awareness is critical [26,  54], as it affects the acceptance of data governance and the smoothness  of  deployment  within  the  organization.', 'It,  therefore,  places  a  higher  demand on managers [48, 54].', 'If managers are blind to the importance  of data governance, it will be difficult for employees to understand why  this work is being done and thus ignore the inherent value of data [11]  and vice versa.', 'Moreover, as the volume of data continues to grow, or- ganizations need to be able to keenly perceive which data are valuable  and which can be quickly transformed into corporate assets in a short  period; this requires a consistent consensus on data across the organi- zation [2].', 'And this consensus is closely related to the development of  relevant data capabilities [11] because the awareness of the potential of  data determines that companies can cultivate and develop the skills and ', 'Fig.', 'A strategic action framework for data governance.', 'Information&Managemen(2022)1036429\\x0cQ.', 'Zhang et al.', 'In turning data into assets, companies can easily get involved in the  issue of legitimacy.', 'In the legitimacy literature, it has been argued that  organizing  around  data  requires  a  balance  between  legitimacy  and  disruption as it relates to the ability of the business to successfully move  forward  with  change  [33].', 'If  an  organization’s  actions,  fundamental  values,  culture,  etc.,  are  strongly  challenged  and  questioned  by  the  public, it can compromise or even fail its work [33, 102].', 'Therefore, a  good strategy for building data legitimacy is to formulate a compelling  blueprint [12].', 'According to this, it is extremely easy for companies to  package their successes in the process of data governance into special- ized solutions that can establish an identity of legitimacy among their  peers or even across industries.', 'And this requires maintaining a balance  between the disruption and the legitimacy of data governance around  the entire lifecycle.', 'Strategic actions necessary to deploy data governance ', 'In  the  case  observed  in  this  paper,  the  necessary  strategic  actions—investment  in  digital  technologies  and  design  of  governance  mechanisms—ensured  the  successful  deployment  of  data  governance.', 'Data governance is a collective action involving multiple actors [11],  and this action can be taken jointly by the key company and partners and  sustained by consistent strategic actions.', 'As with the two key strategic  actions mentioned in our work, while these strategic actions are often  initiated,  coordinated,  and  key  decisions  made  by  the  manager  [34],  mutual  coordination,  collaboration,  and  complementarity  of  actors  across hierarchies and systems is also necessary undoubtedly [94].', 'We argue that investment in digital technologies is a fundamental  strategic action to secure data governance deployment.', 'The diffusion of  digital technologies in organizations transforms strategic activities [23],  orchestrates  and  controls  organizational  processes  promptly  by  opti- mizing information exchange and communication [78], drives “changes  in governance modes” and “affects collaborative dynamics” ([18], p.', 'Thus, the development of digital technologies offers  unprecedented  opportunities  for  the  deployment  of  data  governance,  which  not  only  means  that  companies  can  access  more  efficient  data  collection, analysis, and sharing technologies at a lower cost than before  [37, 73] but also means that they can enhance the data collaboration by  leveraging  the  coupling  between  the  technologies  modular  for  which  different organizations are responsible [90].', 'On  the  other  hand,  we  must  emphasize  the  important  role  of  the  design of governance mechanisms in the progress of data governance  deployment.', 'The two types  of mechanisms  detected in  this paper  are  mainly related to two types of organizational relationships and organi- zational  structures.', 'The  former  focuses  on  the  consensus  among  data  governance subjects; the latter is based on the organizational restruc- turing for carrying out data governance.', 'For organizational relationships  constrained  by  the  resources  of  a  single  enterprise,  enterprises  often  need  the  help  of  external  partners,  and  this  process  is  often  always  accompanied by communication and coordination [2].', 'The former en- sures the proliferation of data governance knowledge and skills within  the  organization.', 'The  latter  allows  data  governance  teams  to  remain  sufficiently flexible.', 'Having iterative communication and coordination  makes  it  easier for organizations  to develop  consistent  solutions  with  external partners.', 'For organizational structure, a sound organizational  structure can resolve conflicts between different hierarchies regarding  decision-making  authority  and  between  centralization  and  decentral- ization, thus autonomously deciding which organizational unit has the  authority  to take  actions related  to data governance [53,  67].', 'Digital  technologies  not  only  support  the  data  governance  activities  but  also  drive the changes in organizational structures [106].', 'As a result, orga- nizations are more likely to have a relatively flat structure for achieving  an  important  strategic  goal—data  governance  in  this  paper.', 'This  not  only  facilitates  more  efficient  information  communication  [106]  but ', 'Discussion and conclusion ', 'In this qualitative study, we systematically analyzed the key activ- ities of enterprises deploying data governance and the strategic actions  designed and implemented for this purpose, using the following theo- retical contributions and management insights.', 'Theoretical implications ', 'First, our study contributes  to the extant literature on data gover- nance.', 'As we clarify in the theoretical background, prior existing liter- ature has examined data governance in detail in two streams (e.g., [2, 8,  11]) –  the process of data assetization [53, 67, 69] and the control of  data quality [74, 85].', 'Apart from a little review literature (e.g., [2, 8,  48]), however, few studies have attempted to integrate the two streams  and  explain  clearly  where  companies  need  to  start  to  deploy  data  governance, especially as it becomes gradually a collective action [11].', 'This study, therefore, hopes to take this critical step.', 'Our study is based  on an integrated data governance concept that defines four important  components  of  data  governance—data  collaboration,  perceptions  of  data  potential,  developing  capabilities,  and  the  establishment  of  data  legitimacy—that  epitomize  data  governance  as  a  collective  action  spreading from the corporate level to the societal level.', 'Thus, this study  contributes to the literature of data governance and the collective action  within it.', 'Furthermore, this study contributes to solving the “first mile”  and “last mile”  data problems.', 'Existing research has focused more on  how to address these issues through data-related rules, standards, and  procedures.', 'This study offers a new way of thinking.', 'We believe that  data collaboration is a very important way for traditional enterprises to  provide initial data collection and analysis capabilities to address data  silos within the enterprise and accelerate the process of aligning data  with  the  business.', 'Through  cognitive  transformation  and  capability  development,  enterprises  can  improve  employees’  perception  of  data  potential and their ability to process data, thereby building data legiti- macy  to protect  against the  risks  of  data stewardship  and  developing  deeper levels of data awareness.', 'Second, our work contributes to the intersection of data governance  and strategic action fields.', 'It has been shown that data governance is a  complex  project  that  requires  long-term  commitment  and  ongoing  engagement [11, 20], and as such, organizations often need to formulate  a series of “goal-oriented action(s)” for it ([67], p.', 'However, due to  the  excessive  focus  on  data  governance  models  and  frameworks  in  existing  research,  the  emphasis  on  strategic  actions  to  promote  data  governance activities is missing.', 'However, we need to be alert to the fact  that the necessary strategic actions can keep the strategic awareness and  direction of the enterprise in an environment of great industry change  [64], which in our study is data governance.', 'Consequently, we analyze  the strategic actions necessary to carry out data governance in terms of  the  investment  in  digital  technologies  and  the  design  of  governance  mechanisms.', 'The  former  not  only  enables  organizations  to  collect,  analyze  and  share  data  at  a  lower  cost  [37,  73]  but  also  drives  data  collaboration  through  the  development  of  technology  modules  across  organizations  [90].', 'The  latter,  on  the  other  hand,  can  guarantee  the  alignment of subject actions and commitments in data governance by  strengthening or changing membership relationships and organizational  structures (e.g., [2]).', 'Third,  we  contribute  to  the  study  of  the  consequences  of  data  governance  by  proposing  data  legitimacy.', 'As  advocated  by  Abraham  et al.', 'As they emphasize the importance of compliance, we  propose data legitimacy to illustrate what the data governance activities ', 'Information&Managemen(2022)10364210\\x0cQ.', 'Zhang et al.', 'Data legitimacy  is the social acceptance that companies achieve when they deploy data  governance around high-quality  data.', 'Proposing this concept, we can  not  only  provide  an  alternative  direction  for  research  on  the  conse- quences of data governance, but also advance the work of legitimacy in  the field of data governance.', 'Managerial implications ', 'Evidently, on the one hand, our research encourages companies to  engage in data governance—especially in the digital era—to accelerate  the  process  of  data  assetization.', 'As  data  becomes  an  increasingly  important source of new competitive advantage for companies [44], it is  critical to use it to guide business operations and decisions.', 'One study  reported that “Yet having troves of data is of little value in and of itself”  ([97], p.', 'Not only that but as data becomes more and more ubiq- uitous, how to identify valuable data from it and turn it into enterprise  assets has become an important way for enterprises to expand their asset  capacity [2, 67].', 'Our research, therefore, provides a possible approach  for enterprises to deploy data governance.', 'Additionally, the current research shows that, except for particular  circumstances (e.g., companies outsource all data governance work to a  third party), companies still need to provide a range of safeguards, or  strategic actions, for their data governance arrangements.', 'In this study,  we strongly urge companies to focus on digital technology investments.', 'Digital technologies not only disrupt companies’ access to data through  the  advantage  of  more  connectivity  [47,  73]  but  also  changes  the  structure of social relationships in traditional areas [70].', 'Moreover, our  research  strongly  advocates  that  companies  design  a  range  of  gover- nance mechanisms around data governance.', 'Proper governance mech- anisms  can  increase  communication  and  coordination  among  teams  while  enabling  them  to  ensure  sufficiently  flexible  decision-making  authority.', 'Limitations and future directions ', 'Although  we  have  presented  our  research  in  as  much  detail  as  possible, there are still some limitations due to several circumstances,  and this provides some directions for future research to consider.', 'First,  this is a single-case study that will inevitably be challenged by literal  replication (e.g., [105]), despite the rigorous data collection and anal- ysis process we adopted and the focus on the uniqueness of the case it- self.', 'Future research, therefore, needs to be expanded with more cases or  even  mixed  research  methods.', 'In  addition,  as  mentioned  above,  this  study proposes data legitimacy based on the perspective of the conse- quences of data governance, which is premised on the assumption that  the  data  itself,  as  well  as  the  behavior  of  the  enterprise,  is  legal  and  compliant.', 'Therefore, the concept of data legitimacy may still need to be  extended  or  updated  for  specialized  studies  addressing  data  quality,  security,  privacy,  etc.', 'Finally,  we  have  probed  the  strategic  actions  needed to deploy data governance, but data governance is an ongoing  project, and thus the evolution of firms’ digital technology investment  strategies and governance mechanisms over time—e.g., the allocation of  decision-making  authority  and  the  dynamic  adjustment  of  organiza- tional structures—needs further study.', 'Funding ', 'This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foun- dation  of  China  [grant  number  72172031,  71672029]  and  the

store large volumes of data about its citizens and  while  analysis  of  this  data  can  improve  decision-making  and  better  address  individual  needs, this  fails  due  to  a  lack  of  data governance.', 'Data  governance  has  received  growing  attention  from  both  practitioners  and  academics  as  a  promising approach to solving organizational data issues.', 'This paper presents a  review  of  data  governance  literature,  classifying  authors,  research  disciplines,  methods and related theoretical fields, providing researchers with an overview  of  this  emerging  field.', 'The  paper  is  concluded  by  suggesting  four  areas  for  future  development  of  the  data  governance  field  in  the  context  of  the  public  sector.', 'Keywords: Data Governance, Literature Review, E-government, Public sector ', 'Introduction ', 'Although data has long been heralded as “the new oil” [1], organizations still struggle  to  generate  business  value.', 'Especially  public  organizations,  which  routinely  store  large volumes of data about its citizens [2], are keen to pursue new opportunities.', 'Yet  they  are  often  restrained  by  seemingly  tedious  data  problems  [3].', 'Issues  of  quality,  availability  or  accuracy  complicate  data  efforts,  but  solving  these  in  isolation  constitute  short-term  solutions  [4].', 'Harvesting  value  from  data  requires  an  organization-wide approach and as such cannot be solved by the IT group alone [5].', 'Here,  data  governance  has  been  examined  by  both  practitioners  and  academics  as  a  promising approach to solving these organizational data issues [6], [7].', 'The objective  of this paper is to present an overview of the current state of the data governance field  and based on this, identify potential for future research on the governance of data in  the public sector.', 'Many scholars follow Weill and Ross’ [8] definition of IT governance and define  data governance as specifying a framework for decision rights and accountabilities to  encourage desirable behavior in the use of data [4], [6], [7], [9].', 'As such, researchers  have  proposed  initial  frameworks  for  designing  data  governance  [7],  [10],  analysed  influencing  factors  [9],  [10],  observed  the  application  of  data  governance  in  small- medium  enterprises   [11], [12] and  defined  data  governance  principles and activities  [4],  [13].', 'While  the  data  governance  literature  offers  valuable  contributions,  these ', 'A ', 'To close this gap, this paper presents a comprehensive review of data governance  research.', 'While some literature reviews exist, these are focused either on defining the  underlying  principles  of  data  governance  [4]  or  mapping  the  data  governance  activities  related  to  selected  decision  domains  [13].', 'As  data  governance  is  an  emerging academic area, understanding the current state of the field is imperative for  theory  advancing  development,  closes  areas  where  a  plethora  of  research  exists,  and  uncovers  areas  where research is needed” [14], where the specific contribution of cumulative reviews  lies  in  its  ability  to  evaluate  available  literature  on  a  particular  subject  matter  and  inform researchers about a new area for future research [15].', 'This review considers 62  peer-reviewed  journal  publications  and  conference  proceedings  which  study  the  mechanisms involved in governing data as an asset.', 'The paper draws on Schlichter &  Kraemmergaard’s  [16]  methodological  framework  for  conducting  comprehensive  literature  reviews  and  Templier  &  Paré’s  [15]  approach  to  cumulative  literature  reviews.', 'The  purpose  is  twofold.', 'The  first  objective  is  to  gain  an  overview  of  the  current  state  of  the  data  governance  field  by  classifying  authors,  research  disciplines,  methods,  units  of  analysis  and  related  theoretical  areas  of  concern.', 'The  second  objective  is  then,  based  on  the  overview,  to  identify  potent  areas  within  the  governance  of data in  the  public  sector that could  benefit  from  further development.', 'To accomplish  this,  the  paper is  organized  as  follows.', 'In  section  2,  key concepts  of  the review are established and previous literature reviews introduced.', 'In section 3, the  methods  for  carrying  out  the  review  are  described.', 'In  section  4,  findings  from  the  analysis of the selected papers are presented.', 'In section 5, the findings are discussed,  concluding the paper.', 'Data Governance ', 'As  a  common,  widely  accepted  definition  of  data  governance  has  yet  to  be  established,  it  is  imperative  for  this  review  to  clarify  some  aspects  of  the  concept.', 'Where data may be defined as “raw material”, information is data in context [17].', 'In  the  practitioners’  community  the  two  are  often  used  interchangeably,  and  no  distinction  is  made  between  data  governance  and  information  governance  [18].', 'This  may be appropriate for communicating with practice, but does not fit the methodology  of  a  systematic,  cumulative  review,  where  determining  clear  boundaries  for  key  concepts  is  central  [19].', 'Thus,  this  paper  maintains  the  first  distinction  and  focus  solely on data governance.', 'Both  practitioners  and  researchers  frequently  discuss  data  governance  in  the  context  of  data  quality  [9],  [10],  [20]  and  place  great  emphasis  on  improving  data  quality  as  the  main  goal  of  data  governance  [20],  [21].', 'While  data  quality  is  important,  effective  data  governance  must  be  driven  by  and  aligned  with  business  goals  [5],  [17].', 'To  account  for  this,  some  scholars  then  adapt  Weill  &  Ross’  [8]  definition  of  IT governance,  indicating  data-related decisions  and behaviors  must  be ', 'Here,  data  governance  refers  to  the  allocation  of  decision-making  rights  and  related  responsibilities  to  encourage  desirable behavior in the use of data [7], [13], [20].', 'Pierce  et  al.', 'Instead  they  adopt  a  definition of data governance as “the collective set of decision-making processes for  the  use  and  value-maximization  of  an  organization’s  data  assets”  [22],  adding  the  notion that data is an enterprise asset, the value of which organizations must work to  increase.', 'Otto  [20]  then  defines  data  governance as  “a companywide framework  for  assigning  decision-related  rights and duties  in  order to  be  able to adequately  handle  data as a company asset”.', 'This paper adopts an understanding of data governance as  companywide  processes  that  specify  decision-making  rights  and  responsibilities  aligned with organizational goals to encourage desirable behavior in the treatment of  data as an organizational asset.', 'Existing  literature  reviews  have  addressed  concepts  of  data  governance  activities  and data governance principles.', 'In their review of 31 papers, Alhassan et al.', 'They  find  a  high  volume  of  data  governance  activities  are  associated  with  ‘defining’  areas  of  governance,  but  lacking  when  it  comes  to  ‘implementing’  and  ‘monitoring’,  and  suggest  future  research  focus  on  examining  the  latter.', 'Brous  et  al.', 'They  identify  four  principles,  organization,  alignment,  compliance  and  common  understanding,  and  suggest  they  can  be  used  by  researchers  to  focus  on  important  data  governance  issues,  and  by  practitioners  to  develop  effective  data  governance strategy.', 'These  papers  both  aim  to  advance  the  knowledge  base  of  the  field  of  data  governance through their reviews.', 'Yet they do so only on narrowly defined aspects of  the  concept.', 'As  such,  no  systematic  overview  of  data  governance  literature  exists,  leaving  a  gap  about  the  state  of  the  research  field  and  little  direction  for  academic  professionals  and  practitioners  alike  about  where  future  research  should  concentrate  its efforts.', 'It is to close this gap this review addresses the research questions: what is  the  current  state  of  the  data  governance  field  and  what  areas  could  benefit  from  further development?', 'Research Method ', 'To  address  the  questions,  this  review  uses  a  structured  methodology  adopted  from  Templier & Paré’s [15] procedure for conducting a cumulative literature review.', 'The  cumulative  review  compiles  evidence  to  map  bodies  of  literature,  draw  overall  conclusions  and  work  to  provide  readers  with  a  comprehensive  description  of  the  current state of knowledge in the area.', 'Formulating the Problem  • Define Data Governance  • Consider previous literature reviews ', 'Searching the literature  • Search string: \"data governance\" in titles, abstracts, key words  • Databases: Scopus, ProQuest, Web of Science  • Search limited to journal articles and conference proceedings  • Only results in English  • 314 papers found after removing duplicates ', 'Screening for inclusion  • Inclusion: Data governance must be dealt with   • Exclusion: if Data Governance is not mentioned in the abstract or ', 'Extracting data  • Headcount of year, author  • Classification of discipline, method, area of concern ', 'Analysing and presenting results  • Results are presented quantitatively in figures and tables ', 'Figure 1.', 'Structure for research method adapted from Templier & Pare ', 'As such, the research method is divided into five major steps, represented in Figure  1.', 'As this paper follow the steps specified for cumulative reviews, the process is not  meant to iterative, but rather chronological.', 'The first step includes clearly defining the concepts to be studied and establishing  the  boundaries  of  the  review.', 'Where  some  literature  reviews  often  start  wide  and  narrow down throughout the process, cumulative reviews use predefined concepts.', 'As  such,  data  governance  was  defined  in  section  2, and  boundaries of  the  concept  were  established.', 'The  second  step  involves  searching  the  literature  using  a  documented  search  procedure.', 'The  search  was  conducted  in  the  spring  of  2017,  using  the  search  string  “data governance” and included titles, abstracts and author keywords.', 'Only academic  journal publications and conference proceedings were included in the search, as these  for the most part constitute peer-reviewed, up-to-date information that book chapters  do not.', 'Only results in English were considered.', 'Duplicates were removed, leaving a  total number of 314 papers for further examination.', 'The third step includes specifying criteria for excluding or including studies based  on the review’s goals.', 'As a broad and comprehensive search was conducted in step 2,  it  yielded  many  papers  that  were  not  particularly  relevant  to  the  overall  research  questions.', 'To ensure only appropriate papers that help answer the research questions  were selected criteria for inclusion and exclusion were established.', 'Papers were only  selected  if  they  followed  a  definition  of  data  governance  according  to  the  conceptualization  defined  in  section  2,  and  excluded  if  data  governance  was  only  mentioned in  passing,  as  one  of  many  other disciplines.', 'The fourth step involves identifying the type of data to be extracted from the pool  of studies and using a structured approach to do so.', 'To extract data, this paper drew  on a framework for conducting comprehensive literature reviews that was developed  by  Schlichter  and  Kraemmergaard    [16]  to  analyze  a  vast  amount  of  academic  publications.', 'The  framework  specifies  two  strategies  for  extracting  data,  using  headcounts  and  classifications.', 'Headcounts  were  used  to  address  how  many  papers  were published each year, and which authors contributed the most.', 'This was done by  simply  counting  the  number  of  articles  published  per  year  and  counting  how  many  articles each author had published.', 'Classifications  were  used  to  address  what  research  disciplines,  methods,  units  of  analysis and other theoretical or conceptual areas of concern were used to study data  governance.', 'To  classify  papers  according  to  research  disciplines  Schlichter  and  Kraemmergaard’s categories on information systems, computer science, organisation  and  management  were  used  and  health  informatics,  e-government,  education  and  other  were  added  after  reading  the  abstracts  of  the  62  papers  (see  Table  1).', 'For  classifying  papers  according  to  research  methods,  Schlichter  and  Kraemmergaard’s  categories  on  case  study,  theoretical,  survey,  experiment  combined,  and  design  science were used (see Table 2).', 'Additionally, some thematic analysis of the abstracts  was undertaken to classify papers according to what other theoretical areas of concern  are  used  to  study  data  governance,  as  well  as  units  of  analysis.', 'An  open  coding  technique  was  used,  where  categories  were  collected  as  the  papers’  abstracts  were  read.', 'Table 1.', 'Classification of Research Disciplines ', 'Discipline ', 'Description ', 'Information systems ', 'The use or management aspects

process management, data quality management and master data management may be  considered  Theory  for  Design  and  Action,  which  according to  Gregor  is about  “how  to  do  something”  [23],  and  account  for  five  articles  in  total.', 'Contingency  theory,  organizational  design  and  resource  based  view  relate  to  overall  management  of  an  organization.', 'This may be considered Theory for Explaining and Predicting, which is  “understanding  of  underlying  causes  and  prediction,  as  well  as  description  of  theoretical constructs  and  the  relationships among  them”[23],  accounting  for  four of  the  articles.', 'Panopticism,  theory  of  paradoxes  and  system  of  systems  constitute  grander theories mostly concerned with world views.', 'They

concept-centric  analysis  was undertaken and a  pattern  emerged.', 'It is interesting  to  note  however  that  data  governance  is  also  examined  as  a  way  to  manage  data  between  discrete  organizations.', 'Two  papers  even  consider how  data governance can  facilitate data sharing across the private and public sector.', 'Table 7.', 'Unit of analysis ', 'Unit of analysis ', 'Frequency ', 'Organization ', 'Inter-organizational ', 'Cross-sectoral ', 'Regional ', 'Total ', 'Discussion ', 'As such, the state of the data governance field can be tentatively evaluated from the  findings  in  section  4.', 'The  distribution  of  relatively  few  publications  amongst  a  plethora of authors suggest the field has not matured enough for researchers to publish  several articles within the domain.', 'Additionally, the top publishing authors count both  practitioners and academics, which suggests it is a field attracting the attention of both  communities.', 'The  data  governance  field  is  dominated  largely  by  theoretical  methods  and  case  studies,  with  few  studies  using  more  practice-oriented  methods,  like  design  science,  action  research  or  experiments.', 'Considering  the  presence  of  practitioners  in  the  research  field  and  the  potential  benefits  to  be  derived  from  implementing  data  governance in practice, more studies of this kind should be encouraged ', 'In  the  same  vein,  most  of  the  publications  are  within  the  fields  of  information  systems and computer science, which could suggest the field is still largely driven by  the IT oriented researchers.', 'This could also have implications for how the discourses  surrounding  data  governance  are  shaped.', 'Few  studies  are  conducted  within  E- government  and  Organization  and  Management,  which  suggests  data  governance  is  still anchored in IT, and has yet to become a general management discipline.', 'A heavy  presence  of  theoretical  papers  in  largely  technical  fields  could  slow  or  obscure  the  development  of  data  governance  as  a  management  practice,  because  it  may  continuously be framed as an IT responsibility.', 'Additionally, a majority of papers also  draw  on  IT  governance  to  conceptualize  data  governance,  which  only  work  to  strengthen the idea of data as something inherently connected to IT.', 'In  addition,  many  of  the  related  theoretical  areas  are  predominantly  prescriptive,  rendering  data  governance  largely  intangible.', 'Presented  mainly  through  frameworks  or charts, in the various management and design disciplines, data governance is dealt  with on a formal basis, with little attention paid to the context it will be implemented  in.', 'Some  studies  do  adapt  more  explanatory  approaches,  such  as  the  theories  of  panopticism  and  paradoxes,  but  there  is  little  no  attention  paid  to  the  processes  of  change and implementation of these

'However, in order for data science to be successful, it is vital that asset management organizations are able to trust the integrity of the digital environment [2, 3].', 'Managers have, in the past, found it difﬁcult to trust data science products as, for example, the data is often found to be lacking the required quality [4–7].', 'Furthermore, as suggested by Wallis et al.', 'Managers need to be able to trust data science products before they', 'IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2020 Published by Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020 M.', 'Hattingh et al.', 'Eds.): I3E

implications and wrong decisions can be expensive and risky.', 'A lack of trust in data science projects can often be attributed to the lack of data quality, and the success of data science projects is often highly reliant on the quality of the data being used [8–10].', 'There is no single factor deﬁning the successful outcomes of a data science project [11, 12], but recently data governance has gained traction by many organizations as being important for ensuring quality and compliance in data science outcomes [11, 13].', 'However, it remains unclear how data governance contributes to the success of data science outcomes, leading to calls for more research in this area [11, 14, 15].', 'Data Governance can be deﬁned as “the exercise of authority and control (plan- ning, monitoring and enforcement) over the management of data assets” [16] (p.', 'For example, Brous et al.', 'The main objective of the paper is to understand the role of data governance as a factor for successful data science outcomes.', 'Our main research question therefore asks how does data governance contribute to more successful data science outcomes?', 'This paper analyses a case study in the asset management domain with speciﬁc regard for the role of data governance as success factor for data science outcomes.', 'The case under study is managed by Rijkswaterstaat in the Netherlands.', 'Rijkswaterstaat is part of the Dutch Ministry of Infrastructure and Water Management and is responsible for the design, construction, management and maintenance of the main infrastructure facilities in the Netherlands.', 'The paper reads as follows.', 'Section 2 presents the background of literature regarding the relationship between data governance, trust and the digital environment.', 'In Sect.', 'Section 4 describes the ﬁndings of the case study.', 'Section 5 discusses the ﬁndings of the case study and Sect.', 'Literature Background', 'Although more attention has been paid to data governance in the literature in recent years, there have been several calls within the scientiﬁc community for more systematic research into data governance and its impact on the business capabilities of organiza- tions [18–20].', 'Little evidence has been produced so far indicating what actually has to be organized by data governance and what data governance processes may entail [20, 21], and many organizations ﬁnd data governance difﬁcult to implement [22, 23].', 'There appears to be no “one-size-ﬁts-all” approach to data governance [24] and the nuances attached to various domains and organizational types have not yet been extensively described [25, 26].', 'Furthermore, evidence is scant as to the role data gov- ernance plays in ensuring the successful outcomes of data science initiatives [18, 19].', 'Data Governance as Success Factor for Data Science', 'Recent years have witnessed more and more asset management organizations adopting data science initiatives in order to support the digital transformation of their business processes [27, 28], and Van der Aalst [29] go so far as to suggest that organizations without a data science capability may not survive.', 'According to Provost and Fawcett [1] (p.', 'From this perspective, data science encompasses a broad range of knowledge and capabilities such as data-mining and machine learning, which are designed to extract knowledge from data and are important for creating value and moderating risk in data science initiatives.', 'As such, data governance can help organizations make use of data as a competitive asset [21, 23].', 'Data governance aims at maximizing the value of data assets in enterprises [1, 37].', 'For example, capturing electric- and gas-usage data every few minutes beneﬁts the consumer as well as the provider of energy.', 'With active gover- nance of big data, isolation of faults and quick ﬁxing of issues can prevent systemic energy grid collapse [38].', 'Data science can improve asset management decision-making which is needed to facilitate more efﬁcient and secure asset management operations, as well the need for better situational awareness about network disturbances [10, 27].', 'Data science initia- tives such as predictive maintenance modelling generally require big data [10, 30, 31].', 'Asset management organizations often choose to implement data lakes using a variety of architectures and technologies to store big data and to make this data available for use.', 'A data lake is “a central repository system for storage, processing, and analysis of raw data, in which the data is kept in its original format and is processed to be queried only when needed” [32] (p.', 'Data lakes are different to traditional data warehouses which often have their own native formats and structures as data is stored in its original, raw, format [33, 34].', 'Often, the data processing systems which are required to allow the data to be ingested without compromising the data structure are also included in the deﬁnition [32, 34].', 'The data in the data lake is generally immediately accessible, allowing users to utilize dynamic analytical applications [34, 35].', 'This immediate accessibility, as well as the retaining of data in its original format presents a number of challenges regarding management of the data lake, including data quality management, data security and access control [33, 36], as well as in maintaining compliance with regards to privacy [21, 36].', 'As such, data governance has increasingly gained popu- larity as a means of ensuring data quality and maintaining compliance.', 'Managing data quality is considered by many researchers to be an important reason for adopting data governance (e.g. [24, 37, 39]).', 'However, big data can provide asset management organizations with complex challenges in the management of data quality.', 'According to Saha and Srivastava [40], the massive volumes, high velocity and large variety of automatically generated data can lead to serious data quality management issues which can be difﬁcult to manage in a timely manner [41].', 'For example, IoT sensors calibrated to measure the salinity of water may, over time, begin to provide incorrect values due to biofouling.', 'Data science information products often rely on near real-time data to provide timely alerts, and, as such, problems may arise if these data quality issues are not timely detected and corrected.', 'As well as establishing data management processes which manage data quality, data governance should also ensure that the organization’s data management processes', 'P.', 'Brous et al.', 'For example, Panian [43] states that establishing and enforcing policies and processes around the manage- ment of data should be the foundation of effective data governance practice as using big data for data science often raises ethical concerns.', 'Automatic data collection may cause privacy infringements [44, 45] such as cameras used to track trafﬁc on highways which often record personally identiﬁable data such as number plates or faces of persons in the vehicles.', 'Data governance processes should ensure that these personally identiﬁable features are removed before data is shared or used for purposes other than legally allowed.', 'Data governance should therefore establish what speciﬁc data privacy policies are appropriate [39] and applicable across the organization [38].', 'For example, Tallon [46] states that organizations have a social and legal responsibility to safeguard per- sonal data, whilst Power and Trope [47] suggest that risks and threats to data and privacy require diligent attention from organizations.', 'In summary, asset management organizations often choose to implement data science initiatives such as predictive maintenance and anomaly detection, using methods such as data-mining and machine learning, in order to support the digital transformation of their business processes.', 'Many modern data science methods require big data which is often stored and made available through data lakes.', 'However, asset management organizations are increasingly being faced with challenges which impact the success of data science outcomes, often related to: 1.', 'In order to tackle these challenges, data governance assigns responsibilities for decision-making [24], deﬁnes processes for monitoring an managing data quality [41], and deﬁnes policies for monitoring and maintaining compliance with relevant legislation [47].', 'The propositions of the research are based on the results of the background liter- ature review as well as on existing theory regarding the principles of data governance in asset management organizations and the reasons why asset management organizations choose to implement data governance [13, 14, 48].', 'The propositions of the research therefore read as follows: 1.', 'Deﬁning clear roles and responsibilities for data management will result in easier', 'Monitoring and managing data quality will result in more useful outcomes from', 'Compliance monitoring and control is a required condition for data science.', 'As discussed above, the literature shows that many organizations have imple- mented data governance in an attempt to improve trust in data science efforts through the improved management of data quality and compliance to relevant legislation.', 'Data Governance as Success Factor for Data Science', 'Methodology', 'This paper describes a single case study using a multi-method approach to investigate the role of data governance as success factor for data science.', 'Case study is a widely adopted method for examining contemporary phenomenon such as the adoption of data governance [49, 50].', 'In this research we analyze a single case, following the design of an explanatory case study research proposed by Yin [51], including the research question, the propositions for research, the unit of analysis, and the logic linking the data to the propositions.', 'Single case study was selected as being appropriate for this research as there is a need to investigate data governance as success factor for data science in greater detail.', 'In this regard, single case studies may be more appropriate than multiple case studies, as a single case study provides the opportunity to have a deeper understanding of data governance in a speciﬁc context [51, 52], in this case, data science efforts in the asset management domain.', 'As suggested by Eisenhardt [50], the research was contextualized by a review of background literature, identifying the generally accepted roles of data governance in a data science context.', 'The literature background reveals data science initiatives often face a number of challenges, and not all efforts lead to successful outcomes [15, 48, 53].', 'Facing these challenges has led many organizations to adopt data governance as a means of improving the outcomes of data science efforts [13].', 'However, data governance remains a poorly understood concept [22, 36] and its contribution to the success of data science has not been widely researched [36].', 'As discussed above, our main research question therefore asks how does data governance contribute to more successful data science outcomes?', 'Following Ketokivi and Choi [54], deduction type reasoning augmented by con- textual considerations provided the basic logic for the propositions to be tested in a particular context, namely data science in an asset management domain.', 'The data analysis in this research utilizes “within case analysis” [55].', 'Within case analysis helped us to examine the impact of data governance on the success of data science in a single context.', 'In this case, the unit of analysis was a single data science project in the asset management domain.', 'The case selected was managed and implemented by Rijkswaterstaat, often abbreviated to RWS and referred to as such in this paper.', 'RWS is the Directorate-General for Public Works and Water Management and an operational agency of the Ministry of Infrastructure and Water Management of the Netherlands.', 'RWS is charged with the management and maintenance of the major highways, waterways and shipping lanes in the Netherlands.', 'In order to prepare the organization for the case study research project, RWS was provided with information material outlining the objectives of the project.', 'Following the suggestions of Yin [51], the case study was conducted using a multi- method approach and multiple data sources were used.', 'Methods used are document analysis and face-to-face interviews.', 'The interviews were conducted during 2019 taking the form of one-on-one, face-to-face interviews.', 'The interviewees were mainly selected from RWS staff members directly involved in the data science project in various roles, but also included other staff members involved in the governance and management of the data and the monitoring of the data in order to ensure saturation.', 'Secondary data sources included relevant internal documentation, including project', 'P.', 'Brous et al.', 'Company websites which included relevant data governance information and reports on the data science case were also included.', 'Triangulation of aspects of data governance which contribute to the successful outcome of the data science case was made by listing aspects of data governance found in internal docu- mentation and testing these in the one-on-one interviews.', 'In the interviews the inter- viewees were asked as to the contribution of these aspects of data governance towards the successful outcome of the project.', 'In the interviews the interviewees were also asked to name other aspects of data governance that may have had a signiﬁcant contribution to the successful outcome of the data science project but which may have been overlooked.', 'Case Study Description', 'RWS is tasked with the management and maintenance of the national public infras- tructure including the construction and maintenance of shipping lanes, major water- ways (including ﬂood prevention) and national roads and highways.', 'RWS has a spend of approximately €200 million per annum on asphalt maintenance, with operational parameters traditionally focused on trafﬁc safety.', 'In the past this has led to increasing overspend due either to premature maintenance, or to expensive emergency repairs.', 'The prediction of asphalt lifetime based on traditional parameters has been shown to be correct one third of the time.', 'RWS is seeking to reduce these costs by extending the lifespan of asphalt where possible whilst reducing the number of emergency repairs made by adopting data science techniques for the purpose of predictive, “just-in-time” maintenance.', 'Using available big data in a more detailed manner, such as raveling data collected by a Laser Crack Measurement System combined with Weigh-in-Motion data has doubled the prediction consistency.', 'According to RWS ofﬁcials, improving the accuracy of asphalt lifetime prediction has enabled better maintenance planning which has signiﬁcantly reduced premature maintenance, improving road safety and cost savings, and reducing the environmental impact due to reduced trafﬁc congestion and a reduction in C emissions.', 'The data science model uses data related to traditional inspections, historical data generated during the laying of the asphalt, road attribute data and planning data, as well automatically generated, streaming data such as weather data, trafﬁc data, and IoT sensor data.', 'The current model takes about 400 parameters into consideration.', 'According to an RWS ofﬁcial, “this number will only grow, as the (project partners) continue to supply new data”.', 'According to RWS, the ultimate goal is a model that can accurately predict the lifespan of a highway.', 'With regards to deﬁning roles and responsibilities RWS has asked the data man- agers of each of the datasets used in the data science project to each appoint an executive sponsor or data owner.', 'The data owner is a business sponsor.', 'Once own- ership is established, the current and desired future situations are assessed in terms of production and delivery.', 'A roadmap is then established which was translated into concrete actions and a delivery agreement is reached.', 'RWS also uses “open” data from external sources.', 'Due to its many open data partnerships, RWS has implemented a policy of providing knowledge, tools and a government-wide contact network in which', 'Data Governance as Success Factor for Data Science', 'These best practices refer to organization of data management, data exchange with third parties, data pro- cessing methods and individual training.', 'According to staff members, RWS has implemented data governance for their big data in order to remain “future-proof, agile and to improve digital interaction with citizens and partners”.', 'According to an RWS executive manager, “RWS wants to be careful, open and transparent about the way in which it handles big and open data and how it organizes itself”.', 'Furthermore, RWS has introduced the policy of assessing and publishing the monetary cost of data assets in order to raise awareness of the importance of data quality management.', 'This means that every RWS process and every RWS organizational unit is encouraged to be aware of its data needs and the incurred costs.', 'With regards to data quality, RWS has implemented a data quality framework to improve their control of data quality.', 'RWS staff believe that “the return (of the investment) stands or falls with the quality of data and information”.', 'As such, according to RWS staff, the underlying quality of the data and information is of great importance to work in an information-driven way.', 'RWS staff members have suggested that, in the past, a signiﬁcant amount of production time has often been lost due to inadequate data quality.', 'The RWS data quality management process follows an eight step process which begins by identifying: 1.', 'RWS primary processes, and 3.', 'RWS has developed an automatic auditing tool (AAT) in combination with a Manual Auditing Tool (MAT) to monitor the quality of the data as a product in order to further improve its grip on data quality.', 'According to RWS staff, the AAT and the MAT ensured that quality mea- surements were mutually comparable, provided tools for more focused management, and caused a change in the conscious use of data as a strategic asset.', 'Alongside with the AAT, the MAT is considered important as it is not yet possible to automate the monitoring of all data quality dimensions.', 'Data quality measuring is centralized at RWS, the goal being to ensure a standardized working method.', 'However, RWS maintained the policy that every data owner is responsible for improvements to the data management process and the data itself.', 'The RWS data quality framework was based on ﬁtness for use and data quality measurement was maintained according to 8 main dimensions and 47 subdimensions.', 'With regards to compliance, RWS has translated their data policies and principles into a data agenda in which the opportunities, risks and dilemmas of their data policies and ambitions are identiﬁed in advance and are made measurable and practicable.', 'Terms and deﬁnitions have been coordinated with the Dutch legal framework related to the environment to ensure compliance.', 'Responsibilities relating to compliance to pri- vacy laws are centralized and RWS has assigned privacy ofﬁcers to this role.', 'The CIO has the ﬁnal responsibility for ensuring that privacy and security are managed and maintained, however, business data owners are held accountable for ensuring com- pliance to dataset speciﬁc policy and regulations.', 'P.', 'Brous et al.', 'Discussion', 'Case study methodology was used in this research to identify the role that data gov- ernance plays as success factor for data science.', 'The choice for an in-depth, single case study was based on the contemporary nature of both data science and data governance and the need to study data governance as success factor for data science in greater depth.', 'The study was conducted as a single case study and the results should be regarded in this light.', 'Single case study has been criticized in the past due to the difﬁculty of providing a generalizing conclusion [51, 56].', 'In order to overcome this, the data collection made use of multiple sources including reports, presentations and face- to-face interviews.', 'More research is recommended in this area to test the applicability of the propositions in other domains and organizational types.', 'The study was con- ducted in the asset management domain as asset management organizations by nature are often data rich due to the need to monitor the state of the infrastructure assets.', 'This may limit the applicability of the study for domains which are less data intensive, however the essence of generating value from data is likely to be the same in other domains.', 'Proposition 1: Deﬁning Clear Roles and Responsibilities for Data Management Will Result in Easier Generation of Business Value from Data Science Efforts', 'Proposition 1 proposes that data science is likely to generate more business value if responsibilities for data management are clearly deﬁned.', 'RWS has many various open data partners, as well as a large variety of sources from which the data is collected.', 'As a result RWS has experienced difﬁculties in managing responsibilities for data quality and data management processes.', 'RWS has therefore assumed a leadership role in maintaining a government-wide contact network in which knowledge, tooling and best practices with regards to data management and data sharing are shared with other government organizations.', 'Internally, RWS has assigned business sponsors to assume ownership of datasets so that roles and responsibilities of data management are clearly deﬁned.', 'In order to ensure that sufﬁcient resources are made available for data quality management, RWS has also deﬁned a “price” for each dataset so that business owners are aware of the value of each dataset.', 'This allows the organization to treat the data as a business asset, promoting the need to maintain the expected quality of each dataset.', 'Proposition 2: Monitoring and Managing Data Quality Will Result', 'More Useful Outcomes from Data Science Efforts', 'Proposition 2 proposes that data science is more likely to result in useful outcomes if data quality is monitored and controlled.', 'RWS actively monitors their data inputs by means of an “automatic audit tool”.', 'RWS has assembled a library of business rules which form the input for the calculation of the data quality.', 'The results of the calcu- lations are displayed in the form of a dashboard which indicates whether the calculated values fall within acceptable limits or not.', 'The acceptable limits are described in the RWS data quality framework which has standardized the calculation and description of', 'Data Governance as Success Factor for Data Science', 'RWS.', 'The results of the data quality monitor are used to deﬁne which interventions need to be taken in order to achieve the desired levels of quality and also to monitor the effects of the interventions on the data quality.', 'Traditionally, data quality projects at RWS were based on “hearsay” from staff whereby the general feeling was that the quality was below requirements.', 'The AAT has allowed RWS to be more data driven with regards to their data management processes.', 'According to RWS staff, the active monitoring of data quality has led to “identiﬁcation of gaps in data governance, harmonization of processes across organizational departments, increased awareness and cost savings”.', 'Proposition 3: Compliance Monitoring and Control Is a Required', 'Condition for Data Science', 'Proposition 3 proposes that compliance with relevant legislation is a necessary and required condition for data science.', 'RWS has had a central, IT-centered approach to data privacy to ensure that legal requirements and guidelines regarding the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) are standardized and consistent throughout the organization.', 'RWS has published a transparent list of systems in which personal data is collected, and has published detailed instructions as to how personal data may be viewed and, where necessary, deleted.', 'RWS has appointed privacy and compliance ofﬁcers to assume this responsibility and has appointed the CIO has the responsible executive sponsor.', 'The monitoring of other compliance related activities is done using the AAT or the MAT.', 'Responsibility for the actions ﬂowing from the results of the AAT or the MAT lies with the data managers and ownership lies with the data sponsor.', 'This hybrid approach allows RWS to standardize compliance processes where possible, whilst also being able to tailor customized solutions for particular data issues.', 'Currently the feasibility of a nationwide data platform for asphalt pavement data is being explored in which easy data accessibility, authorization, storage, scalability, architecture, plateau planning, solution directions and cost estimations are addressed.', 'Conclusions', 'In this research paper we

data.', 'Hitherto,  companies  have  assigned  accountabilities for DQM mostly to IT departments.', 'They have thereby ignored the organizational  issues  that  are  critical  to  the  success  of  DQM.', 'With  data  governance,  however,  companies  implement  corporate-wide  accountabilities  for  DQM  that  encompass  professionals  from  business  and  IT.', 'This  paper  outlines  a  data  governance  model  comprised  of  three  components  that  build  a  matrix  comparable  to  an  RACI  chart:  data  quality  roles,  decision  areas,  and  responsibilities.', 'The  data  governance  model  documents  the  data  quality  roles  and  their  type  of  interaction  with  DQM  activities.', 'In addition, the paper identifies contingency factors that impact the model configuration.', 'Companies can structure their company-specific data governance model based on these findings.', 'Key  Words:  Data  governance,  IT  governance,  data  quality  management,  data  governance  model,  contingency  theory ', 'INTRODUCTION  Companies are forced to continuously adapt their business models.', 'Global presence requires harmonized  business  processes  across  different  continents,  customers  ask  for  individualized  products,  and  service  offerings must be industrialized [cp.', 'These factors certainly impact the business process architecture  and  the  IT  strategy  of  organizations.', 'Ultimately,  however,  data  of  high  quality  are  a  prerequisite  for  fulfilling  these  changing  business  requirements  and  for  achieving  enterprise  agility  objectives  [2].', 'In  addition to such strategic factors, some operational domains directly rely on high-quality corporate data,  such  as  business  networking  [3-5],  customer  management,  [6-8],  decision-making  and  business  intelligence [9, 10], and regulatory compliance [11].', 'Data  quality  management  (DQM)  focuses  on  the  collection,  organization,  storage,  processing,  and  presentation of high-quality data.', 'In addition, there are organizational issues that must be addressed, such  as  maintaining  sponsorship,  managing  expectation,  avoiding  scope  creep,  and  handling  political  issues  [12-15].', 'Despite  the  organizational  and  business  relevance  of  DQM,  however,  responsibility  for  improving data quality and managing corporate data is often assigned to IT departments [11].', 'Also, many  companies try to  cope with  data  quality  (DQ) issues  by  simply implementing  data  management  or  data  warehouse systems.', 'Surveys on data warehousing failures reveal that organizational rather than technical  issues are more critical to their success [16].', 'Integrated DQM is required in order to address both organizational and technical perspectives.', 'Successful  data  quality  programs  identify  the  organizational  processes  behind  data  quality  [17].', 'With  data  governance,  companies  implement  corporate-wide  accountabilities  for  data  quality  management  that  encompass  professionals  from  both  business  and  IT.', 'Data  governance  defines  roles  and  assigns ', 'It sets up organization-wide guidelines and standards for  DQM, and assures compliance with corporate strategy and laws governing data.', 'There  is  only  limited  research  on  data  governance.', 'Apart  from  a  few  DQM  approaches  dealing  with  accountabilities  [13,  18],  an  elaborate  analysis  of  the  interaction  of  roles  and  responsibilities  and  the  design  of  decision-making  structures  is  missing.', 'Therefore,  this  investigation  incorporates  data  governance sources from consultants, analysts and practitioners [17, 19-24].', 'Both academic and practical sources presume data governance to be a universal approach – one that fits  all enterprises alike.', 'Research on IT governance indicates that the distribution of accountabilities for IT  management differs between companies based on contingencies, such as corporate governance  mode  or  firm  size.', 'Moreover,  several  IT  governance  models  exist,  such  as  centralized  and  decentralized  IT  governance [25-27].', 'Previous research falls short of providing a comparable analysis for data governance  and the accountabilities for DQM.', 'As data governance comprises parts of IT governance, this paper suggests that contingencies affect data  governance  and  that  a  data  governance  configuration  is  specific  to  a  given  company.', 'Essentially,  it  proposes a flexible data governance model composed of roles, decision areas and responsibilities; and it  outlines  which  contingencies  influence  the  company-specific  configuration  of  the  model.', 'Whereas  this  paper  focuses  on  the  accountability  aspect  of  data  governance,  it  does  not  examine  guidelines  and  compliance facets.', 'This  investigation  contributes  to  data  quality  management  research  by  advancing  the  state  of  the  art  regarding data governance.', 'In contrast to prior research, it proposes a contingency approach to decision- making frameworks as part of DQM.', 'The data governance model outlines the three components of such a  framework,  namely  roles,  decision  areas,  and  responsibilities.', 'For  the  components,  the  paper  identifies  typical data quality roles and decision areas, and proposes a method to assign responsibilities.', 'It proposes  a  first  set  of  contingencies  and  demonstrates  their  impact  on  the  data  governance  model.', 'More  specifically, the contingencies impact two main parameters of the model, the organizational structuring of  DQM activities and the coordination mechanisms of decision-making.', 'This approach respects the fact that  each  company  needs  a  specific  data  governance  configuration  contingent  on  a  set  of  context  factors.', 'A  data governance model helps companies to structure and document their data quality accountabilities.', 'The  contingencies  and  their  impact  on  the  model  demonstrate  which  configuration  best  fit  their  company.', 'Finding  the  best  model  configuration  ensures  that  DQM  contributes  to  the  above  mentioned  business  goals of a company.', 'Neglecting it means that DQM runs the risk of being just an end in itself.', 'The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: The next section introduces and relates IT governance  to data governance.', 'The following section outlines the idea and the components of the data governance  model.', 'It  proposes  data  quality  roles,  decision  areas,  and  responsibilities.', 'Subsequently,  a  section  is  devoted  to  the  contingency  theory  of  data  governance.', 'It  outlines  a  contingency  model  based  on  two  parameters  –  organizational  structuring  and  coordination  mechanisms.', 'The  last  section  summarizes  this  paper and discusses its managerial and research implications.', 'BACKGROUND ', 'Governance for Data Quality Management  Governance  in  general  “refers  to  the  way  the  organization  goes  about  ensuring  that  strategies  are  set,  monitored,  and  achieved”  [28,  p.35].', 'Corporate  governance  sets  the  institutional  and  policy  framework ', 'Different accepted sources give recommendations for the definition of concrete policies  and principles for corporate governance [e.g. 29].', 'Based on these principles, companies must translate the  overall  guidance  into  concrete  guidelines  for  different  organizational  domains,  such  as  the  accounting  department,  the  IT  organization,  etc.', 'Establishing  governance  for  data  quality  management  requires  a  clear understanding of its scope and its relationships to other domains.', 'To a certain extent data governance is comprised by IT governance [20].', 'This perception is related to the  understanding  of  data  management  being  a  discipline  of  IT  management.', 'On  the  other  hand,  most  IT  governance research analyzes technological, IT systems focused IT management functions and decision  areas, such as IT infrastructure management, IT use management, IT architecture, and IT investment [25,  30].', 'Organizational issues that are outside the scope of IT management, such as maintaining sponsorship,  managing  expectation,  avoiding  scope  creep,  and  handling  political  issues  are  an  important  aspect  of  DQM  [12-15].', 'For  example,  data  governance  publications  demand  business  data  stewards  assuring  that  data  quality  policies  are  followed  by  business  processes  [13,  20,  22].', 'Business  data  stewards  are  professionals  from  functional  departments  and  are  not  part  of  the  IT  organization.', 'Furthermore,  data  is  owned by the enterprise or the shareholders of the enterprise [13, 17].', 'In contrast, IT assets, such as IT  systems or databases, are owned by the IT organization.', 'Moreover, data and informatio are often treated  as  an  “asset”  or  “product”,  i.e.  an  integral  production  factor  of  the  company  [32].', 'Figure  1  shows  the  scope of DQM within the context of IT and quality management.', 'IT\\xa0 management', 'Quality management', 'Data\\xa0quality\\xa0 management', 'Figure 1.', 'Data quality management in the context of IT and quality management ', 'This paper refers to data quality management as quality-oriented data management, i.e. data management  focusing  on  collecting,  organizing,  storing,  processing,  and  presenting  high-quality  data.', 'Data  or  information quality is defined on the basis of two consentient aspects: first, the dependence of perceived  quality  on  the  user’s  needs;  second,  the  so-called  “fitness  for  use”,  which  is  the  ability  to  satisfy  the  requirements  of  intended  use  in  a  specific  situation  [33,  34].', 'One  common  denominator  of  these  definitions is that DQ is considered a multi-facet construct, consisting of a set of DQ attributes (referred  to  as  data  quality  dimensions)  requiring  consumer  assessment  [35].', 'Examples  of  these  dimensions  are  accuracy, completeness, consistency, relevancy and timeliness.', 'IT Governance  Besides  lower  costs  and  more  informed  employees,  enterprises  seek  competitive  advantages  through  investments  in  IT.', 'Enterprises  have  often  been  unable  to  realize  the  expected  value  from  strategic  IT  investments.', 'Henderson  and  Venkatraman  [36]  argue  that  this  inability  results  from  misalignment  between business and IT strategy.', 'Successful initiatives demand the combined efforts of technology and  business specialists which are directed, controlled and coordinated through IT governance arrangements ', 'The  term  data  is  often  distinguished  from  information  by  referring  to  data  as  “raw”  or  simple  facts  and  to  information as data put in a context or data that has been processed [10, 31].', 'In line with most data or information  quality publications, the terms data and information are used interchangeably throughout the paper.', 'IT  governance  –  as  a  subset  of  corporate  governance  –  “assists  in  the  achievement  of  corporate  success  by  both  efficiently  and  effectively  deploying  secure  and  reliable  information  through  the  application of technology” [37, p.', 'Prior IT governance research points to the importance of aligning IT governance arrangements with the  overall enterprise context.', 'Scholars investigated the relationship between a firm’s IT governance design  and  its  organizational  context  factors  [25-27,  37,  38].', 'The  underlying  assumption  is  that  there  is  no  universal IT governance design for all enterprises and that the context factors impact the contribution of  IT governance in enhancing corporate performance.', 'Contingency theory of organizational design has outlined similar dependencies: The relationship between  some characteristic of an organization and its organizational effectiveness is determined by contingencies.', 'Traditionally,  contingency  theory  addressed  environmental  fit  or  fit  of  organizational  structure  with  environmental  conditions  [39-41].', 'Scholars  later  enhanced  contingency  theory  by  taking  into  account  internal conditions, such as structural formalization and specialization, as contingencies [42-44].', 'Following  this  contingency  approach,  IT  governance  research  came  up  with  IT  governance  patterns  or  models – each model fitting a different set of contingencies.', 'Early studies examined the singular effects of  organizational  context  variables  taken  from  classical  contingency  theory  (such  as  organization  size,  competitive  strategy,  locus  of  decision-making  authority/control)  on  single  IT  functions  [45-48].', 'They  proposed  two  IT  governance  models:  In  centralized  models  corporate  IT  performs  all  IT  functions,  whereas  in  decentralized  models  business  units’  IT  performs  these  tasks.', 'A  third  pattern,  the  federal  model, distinguishes between two types of IT functions: The management of the use of IT is decentralized  to business units, and the management of IT is centralized [49, 50].', 'The federal form is associated with  hybrid (including matrix) structures within multidivisional firms [51].', 'Acknowledging the reality that firms are influenced by more than one contingency factor simultaneously,  Sambamurthy and Zmud [25] investigated the influence of multiple contingencies on the location of IT  decision rights (decentralized, centralized, and federal).', 'Further, they added a third type of IT functions  and distinguished between IT infrastructure management,  IT use  management and project management.', 'The  reasoning  behind  IT  governance  shifted  from  performance  of  IT  functions  to  authority  for  IT  decision-making within these functions.', 'Brown [27] shifted the focus from the organizational level to the  business unit level.', 'In the hybrid model she proposed, the IT use function is decentralized to some but not  all business units within the same enterprise.', 'She argued that to understand these different arrangements,  context variables need to be addressed at the business unit level.', 'The IT governance archetypes proposed by Weill [30] further contribute to a more elaborated view on IT  governance  models.', 'Instead  of  two  organizational  units  (corporate  IT  vs.', 'IT),  he  considers  senior  business executives, IT professionals from corporate teams and business units, and business unit leaders  or  business  process  owners  having  decision  authority  for  IT  management  functions.', 'In  addition,  he  distinguishes five major decision areas, namely IT principles, IT architecture, IT infrastructure strategies,  business  application  needs,  and  IT  investment  and  prioritization.', 'Finally,  he  extends  IT  governance  models by a third element, the distinction between decision rights and input rights.', 'However, he limited  the  number  of  possible  combinations  of  those  three  dimensions  to  six  mutually  exclusive  archetypes.', 'Although  the  archetypes  define  IT  governance  on  an  enterprise-wide  level,  Weill  suggested  that  IT  governance in large enterprises should also be designed and assessed on a business unit level or by region  or groups of business units.', 'Weill [30] named certain factors as contingent on IT governance, but did not  specify how these factors influence the IT governance archetypes.', 'Later, Weill and Ross [38] partly filled  this gap by analyzing the contingency factor performance .', 'In  conclusion,  IT  governance  research  has  analyzed  two  domains:  the  organizational  structuring  of  IT  activities and the placement of decision-making authority, and the effect of multiple contingencies on the  contribution of IT governance to corporate performance.', 'It proposes three dimensions that compose an IT  governance model: roles, major decisions areas and assignment of accountabilities.', 'IT governance models  can be designed on several organizational levels.', 'Data Governance  Data governance specifies the framework for decision rights and accountabilities to encourage desirable  behavior in the use of data.2 To promote a desirable behavior, data governance develops and implements  corporate-wide data policies, guidelines and standards that are consistent with the organization’s mission,  strategy,  values,  norms  and  culture  [cp.', 'Compared  with  the  extensive  body  of  IT  governance  research,  academic  research  on  data  governance  is  in  its  infancy.', 'Data  quality  management  approaches  address  tasks  for  improving  and  sustaining  high-quality  data.', 'For  example,  Total  Data  Quality  Management  (TDQM)  [12,  31,  32]  proposes  detailed  tasks  for  defining,  measuring,  analyzing  and  improving information quality organized in a cycle.', 'These approaches deal with DQM accountabilities by  describing  data  quality  roles  and  their  responsibilities.', 'English  [13],  for  example,  portrays  19  roles  and  their responsibilities in his Total Quality data Management (TQdM) approach.', 'He distinguishes business  from IT responsibilities and suggests three teams with overarching accountability for specific decisions.', 'Table  1  depicts  the  contribution  of  these  two  DQM  approaches,  that  of  the  framework  for  Information  Quality Management (IQM) [15], and of the DQ program by Redman [18] to data governance.3  ', 'Accountabilities  IPM manages information  process and resulting product  Each role has defined  accountabilities; teams have

governance  [21]  sources  from  consultants,  analysts  and  practitioners.', 'All  these  approaches  propose  between  three  and  five  key  roles  for  data  quality  programs  and  outline  their  responsibilities.', 'They  use  the  term  “data  stewardship”  to  refer  to  accountabilities,  committal,  and  collaborative  business  practices  for  managing  data  as  an  asset  [17].', 'In  their  book  on  customer  data  integration  (CDI)  Dyché  and  Levy  [20]  devote  a  chapter  to  data  governance  and  stewardship.', 'For their twelve CDI roles, they suggest detailed skill profiles to facilitate the assignment of  employees to roles.', 'In  the  absence  of  academic  definitions  of  data  governance,  this  definition  was  adapted  from  the  IT  governance  definition of Weill [30].', 'These four approaches have been chosen because they are comprehensive DQM examinations with a substantial  portion of business-related responsibilities.', 'They focus on long-term data quality improvement and error prevention  rather than error correction.', 'In  conclusion,  all  available  data  governance  sources  from  scholars  and  practitioners  focus  on  organizational  structuring  and  the  placement  of  decision-making  authority  for  DQM.', 'However,  an  elaborate  analysis  of  the  interaction  of  roles  and  responsibilities  and  the  design  of  decision-making  structures is missing.', 'Compared with IT governance research, data governance sources have hitherto only  addressed one of the two domains.', 'All sources postulate a universal data governance approach – one that  should  fit  all  companies  alike.', 'They  fall  short  of  analyzing  the  interrelation  of  the  distribution  of  accountabilities for DQM and contingency factors.', 'Moreover, they do not distinguish more than one data  governance  design.', 'This  might  be  the  reason  why  companies  find  it  difficult  to  set  up  and  maintain  organizational structures designed to assure and sustain high-quality data throughout the enterprise.4  ', 'The next two sections aim at narrowing the gap between the insights IT governance research provides and  the state of current data governance research.', 'They suggest that contingencies affect data governance and  that a data governance configuration is specific to a given

methodology described supersedes, to a certain degree, the classical generation of human literature reviews, especially for cases where the review focuses on ‘‘central topics’’ according to the review

stated that an ‘‘effective review creates a ﬁrm foundation for advancing knowledge.’’ It facilitates a ‘‘theory development and closes areas where a plethora of research ﬁndings exists, and uncov- ers areas where research is needed’’ [7] In recent decades, researchers have established various methods to enhance a scientiﬁc literature analysis, and these methods can be clas- siﬁed into different groups.', 'The traditional approach consists of manual reading, the extraction of important key ﬁndings and statements, their comparison and evaluation, and a sum- marizing of knowledge.', 'These methods have been named ‘‘traditional literature reviews’’ [8], [9].', 'Due to the growing number of publications, however, the risk of ending up with an information bias has increased because the ﬁnding and', 'R.', 'Buchkremer et al.: Application of Artificial Intelligence Technologies', 'Driven by this problem, further technical approaches have been developed, especially in the area of medicine.', 'The systematic analysis is often biased by the development of the individual author writing strategy.', 'At the heart of this strategy lies the ﬁrst deﬁnition of speciﬁc ques- tions for which corresponding publications are already known to the authors.', 'Because the search process is very demanding without modern tools, review teams have been formed to work through this process together [10], [13], [14].', 'Another approach based on both traditional and systematic methods is meta-analysis.', 'In this case, it is not only essential to ﬁnd and evaluate the literature, the setting of ranking criteria is often needed.', 'This takes external (meta-) factors into consid- eration.', 'For example, factors such as the number of reviews, the reputation of the journal and authors, and the references are being used.', 'Furthermore, contents are also evaluated to check whether research gaps can be identiﬁed [15]–[17].', 'The support infrastructure to conduct literature research and evaluate results has developed further in recent years through the Internet in general, automated search algorithms and extensive literature databases, which, as already brieﬂy mentioned, requires adjustments to classical retrieval meth- ods.', 'In the ﬁeld of systematic analysis, a growing interest in advanced methods appears to exist because the challenge of forming teams to handle the complex search and evaluation is often not performed by one person alone [6], [13].', 'In the context of this paper, the systematic reviews are generated by a combination of tools and processes that largely belong to the ﬁeld of natural language processing (NLP).', 'It can help to generate an effective and successful literature review with manageable effort despite a very large number of publications.', 'To achieve this goal, text mining subrou- tines such as latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), text cluster- ing or text bootstrapping are applied in combination with machine learning algorithms.', 'Furthermore, the improved analysis is now made possible with the increased computing capacity required for automated text analysis [3], [18]–[22].', 'Fayyad et al.', 'Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) in 1996 and stated that ‘‘it is only natural to turn to computational techniques to help us unearth meaningful patterns and structures from the massive volumes of data,’’ as well as that ‘‘practical computational constraints place severe limits on the subspace that can be explored by a data-mining algorithm’’ [23].', 'The applied tech- niques from KDD, such as ‘‘data mining,’’ ‘‘artiﬁcial neural networks’’ or ‘‘support vector machines,’’ as well as the pro- cess steps ‘‘preparation,’’ ‘‘modeling’’ and ‘‘postprocessing,’’ can be found in the technical implementations of a systematic literature review (SLR), with the result that the approaches described by Arji et al.', 'At ﬁrst, it may appear that limitations from the past can be neglected due to technological advancements and cloud computing, but in comparison to the past, the amount of data to be analyzed has become more extensive [1], [2].', 'VOLUME 7, 2019', 'R.', 'Buchkremer et al.: Application of Artificial Intelligence Technologies', 'Current scientiﬁc articles and their metadata are listed in online databases of publishers and other search engines as part of the publishing process.', 'Older scientiﬁc articles can be found in databases so that simple keyword search queries can lead to very large amounts of search results.', 'To get mostly relevant results, users must optimize search parameters [25].', 'This optimization is mostly sophisticated and unintuitive such that suitable experience in the operation of search engines is required [26].', 'Moreover, there is a lack of structured approaches on how big data or artiﬁcial intelligence concepts can be leveraged in this space.', 'Based on the work of vom Brocke et al.', 'SLR process, the fuzzy-based search query generation of MacFarlane et al., as well as the text mining methods of Liu et al., an approach will be presented in this paper wherein different online databases can be partially or fully searched via automated procedures and evaluated with respect to speciﬁc scientiﬁc topics [10], [18], [19].', 'Fayyad et al.', 'Today, text mining technologies are used to support systematic reviews across various research areas [14], [27], [28].', 'According to Yu and Menzies, however, it is a ‘‘relatively simple task to ﬁnd a few relevant papers for any particular research query.’’ However, the problem is ‘‘not to ﬁnd a few papers, but instead to ﬁnd the most relevant papers.’’ They consider different methods, such as search-query optimization methods, reference-based proce- dures, supervised learning, semisupervised learning, unsu- pervised learning, and active learning, and they name it FAS [29].', 'A fundamental problem of earlier models is the lack of recognition of the application in practice.', 'With the model FAS, Yu and Menzies have stated themselves that the model has been tested only in the ﬁeld of SLR of ‘‘soft- ware development’’ and that, in other ﬁelds, investigations are missing [29].', 'Although different models mentioned so far demonstrate how researchers could include the model in their investigations, concrete practical case studies or evidence of transferability to other scientiﬁc areas are rarely avail- able [27].', 'Moreover, there is a lack of documented structured approaches that support researchers in applying text analytics for their reviews [30].', 'In this contribution, various phases are therefore discussed using practical case studies to facilitate their application in a variety of research areas.', 'The ﬁrst step of a literature search is supported by infor- mation retrieval methods, and it to deﬁne the range and purpose by setting a search query range in advance [31]–[34].', 'Various truncation-, proximity- and Boolean operators can be used to deﬁne the relationship between semantic terms that have been enriched by various thesauri [28], [32].', 'Ontologies, as well as their enrichment (for example, via bootstrapping), have been extensively used for mapping relationships in various domains [35]–[38]; how- ever, a combined approach by utilizing mining and learning procedures, as well as advanced information retrieval, is still lacking.', 'We also would like to address an important inter- mediate step, namely, the generation of the literature corpus.', 'Because various steps from a large set of possibilities lead to the corpus and many possibilities result from the corpus, we selected a model illustrated as an artiﬁcial intelligence double funnel (see Figure 5).', 'The collection of semantic terms to build a taxonomy or an ontology may generally be pursued via supervised (requires manual labeling and training), reinforcement learning, such as bootstrapping or unsupervised learning (using automated classiﬁcation procedures) [3], [39], [40].', 'Relevant text clus- ters for semantic enrichment may be identiﬁed by using mathematical algorithms, such as k-means [41] or maximum entropy models [42], [43].', 'These methods have also been used to identify thematic areas within a text [44].', 'Within this paper, only abstracts of scientiﬁc papers are used to create a large body of literature.', 'On the one hand, abstracts and keywords are, most of the time, available in many online databases without access restrictions; however, on the other hand, the abstracts provide the highest information density within a corresponding scientiﬁc publication [45], [46].', 'III.', 'STIRL – GENERATION AND APPLICATION OF SYSTEMIC TAXONOMIES VIA INFORMATION RETRIEVAL AND SEMANTIC LEARNING The STIRL methodology presented in this work (see Figure 1) leverages learnings from previous studies that apply the use of ‘‘text mining’’ and ‘‘information retrieval’’ to sup- port systematic reviews: Felizardo et al.', 'Xiao and Watson provide a current literature review typology frame- work for stand-alone (describe, test, extend, critique) as well as background reviews [17].', 'STIRL supports descriptive as well as critical reviews since all of them are denominated as ‘‘include all.’’', 'Thomas et al.', 'Therefore, we combine current literature review methodologies [8] with state-of-the-art text mining approaches [48], [49] into a process model, which we used for the analysis described in this paper - see Figure 1.', 'The phases of STIRL are presented in detail within the following subsections.', 'A.', 'INFORMATION RETRIEVAL The collection of scientiﬁc articles represents a major ‘‘side effect’’ of any scientiﬁc research process, and it is often supported by classical information retrieval [34].', 'An aggre- gated literature set often comprises a vast amount of papers where the subject broadness is often deﬁned by the research scope.', 'For ‘‘extend’’ and ‘‘test’’ literature reviews [31], the authors thoroughly select high-quality articles in a magnitude of approximately two hundred articles by applying expert knowledge.', 'The articles generally provide high overall infor- mation density with respect to the topic in question.', 'To mitigate the ‘‘garbage-in-garbage-out’’ effect,', 'VOLUME 7, 2019', 'R.', 'Buchkremer et al.: Application of Artificial Intelligence Technologies', 'FIGURE 1.', 'STIRL methodology – the artificial intelligence double funnel.', 'We would like to point out that ‘‘infor- mation retrieval’’ is not a new technology.', 'It has been in use for decades but has mostly been used by trained infor- mation scientists or librarians.', 'However, we extend the use of classical information retrieval by reinforcement learning, which produces signiﬁcantly more hits than conventional online searching.', 'In addition, we recommend the generation of text clouds, which allows for visualization of terms from the semantic proximity of known search terms.', 'We suggest that the application of basic information retrieval algorithms should be used by every scientist because it is quite easy to understand and because it is becoming more and more indispensable due to the greatly increased number of scien- tiﬁc articles.', 'We suggest focusing on Boolean, proximity and truncation operators since almost all literature portals offer their use.', 'Our approach applies a fuzzy-based query and aggrega- tion procedure where the input vocabulary gets enhanced by a semisupervised learning procedure, which can also be regarded as bootstrapping since a small set of terms gets accumulated step by step using ‘‘precision’’ and ‘‘recall’’ as evaluation criteria [3].', 'Sometimes it might be essential to get a broader overview that covers more distant areas of the research subject – with our new approach, it is possible to extend the review process to get a ‘‘view beyond the horizon’’ [50].', 'Therefore, it is essential to formulate a comprehensive search query where several thousand hits may be obtained.', 'A search query for ‘‘data science,’’ for example, should also include ‘‘big data,’’ and it may also include ‘‘artiﬁcial intelligence’’ since AI technologies are often related to big data procedures [35].', 'A search for ‘‘customer relationship management,’’ for exam- ple, should also include the abbreviation ‘‘crm’’ as well as the search term ‘‘customer’’ in proximity to the abbreviation since ‘‘CRM’’ is often used for ‘‘certiﬁed reference mate- rial’’ [36].', 'A search query should therefore be enhanced by', 'MeSH or WordNet ([37], [38].', 'To search for medical diseases, we thus could include articles where the medical term has been intercepted by other terms (‘‘bacterial infections’’ and ‘‘bacterial skin infections’’).', 'A search query to ﬁnd

mentioned in chapter II are generally selected to improve the precision of a search.', 'At this point, however, high precision [39] is not yet essential if the primary objective is to obtain a view beyond the horizon related to a given subject.', 'To break down the surplus of articles due to query extensions, subsequent analytical methods may be required.', 'However, the magnitude of the surplus needs to be optimized via search query optimization steps [39].', 'Thus, by applying our STIRL methodology, we switch between recall and precision enhancing methods until we end up with the ﬁrst comprehensive literature corpus.', 'B.', 'TAXONOMY ENHANCEMENT Moed and Halevi illustrate that the level of downloads within a given research subject is highest for review articles [51].', 'In accordance with our STIRL methodology, we suggest separately identifying and classifying a set of review papers because they may play an important role in generating sys- temic taxonomies or ontologies [17], [52].', 'Review articles help by deﬁning borders and speciﬁcs of a given research ﬁeld.', 'Systematic reading and scanning of review articles supported by classiﬁcation tools and

Application of Artificial Intelligence Technologies', 'Finally, we expand our search queries through auto- matic classiﬁcation of the literature corpus (for an overview of text extraction methodologies, see [18]).', 'Thus, taxonomies taken from review articles and through automatic classiﬁ- cation of a larger research framework will be combined.', 'Throughout the full STIRL methodology, it is recommended to constantly monitor the precision / recall ratio that may require manual reading of abstracts or full articles.', 'In conclusion, it is important to dissect the corpus of docu- ments into different topics.', 'According to the subject area to be examined, there are different approaches in the literature that discuss an optimal number of topics.', 'Through a normalized mutual information (nMI) process, it can be quantitatively compared to the output of clusters and used as an external validation source.', 'This results in how close the individual clusters are to the underlying taxonomy [54].', 'In addition, pointwise mutual information (PMI) can be used to determine the correlation of topics.', 'The coherence is deﬁned as:', 'PMI (k) =', 'N (cid:88)', 'The larger the PMI is, the more likely it is to imply that the topics k and p are coherent.', 'As a rule, topics are formed with a number of 10 top words [55], [56].', 'Further methods for determining the best number of topics, which are partly based on the PMI, are known as the ‘‘Elbow Method’’ [57] or the ‘‘Davies Bouldin Index’’ [44], [58].', 'Due to numerous variations of those methods with their own advantages and disadvantages, we reference existing papers related to this topic.', 'For example, Liu et al.', 'The generated taxonomy is then applied to the full liter- ature corpus.', 'Precision / recall ratios [52] can provide an indication for evaluation of a given taxonomy.', 'In case of a nonsatisfying evaluation, the taxonomy should be further improved.', 'In accordance with state-of-the-art text mining methods, we suggest an iterative approach between various phases of STIRL.', 'Both supervised and unsupervised learning techniques can be applied [60], [61].', 'Once the evaluation results are satisfactory with respect to the precision-to-recall ratio, the systemic taxonomy can be applied.', 'C.', 'BOOTSTRAPPING Designations and abbreviations disambiguate over time and vary according to the context of the topic.', 'Just as CRM can stand for ‘‘customer relationship management,’’ it can also be synonymous with ‘‘certiﬁed reference material,’’ as we explained earlier.', 'For diseases directly related to the term ‘‘cancer,’’ we currently ﬁnd approximately 5,000 terms in the catalog of the National Library of Medicine (MeSH catalog), and if different spellings are taken into account, there are even more.', 'Even among experts, the scope of terminology or the degree of disambiguation is not always fully clear.', 'Especially for amateurs in a ﬁeld, it is a challenge to ﬁnd the right search terms for diseases.', 'However, to simplify this process, we use the know-how of experts that have published articles about it to deﬁne the search term scope.', 'An initial set of articles found that way may provide further terms that are often located in close proximity to the terms already used.', 'Together with the new terms, a subsequent search is performed until no new search terms can be found with rea- sonable effort.', 'Similar to the small strap, which helps to pull up the entire boot, an initial search helps.', 'The veriﬁcation of the bootstrapping process should always be checked against the precision-to-recall ratio.', 'D.', 'CORPUS An important intermediate result of the STIRL model is the creation and quality assurance of the text corpus generated with the methods described above.', 'It contains scientiﬁc arti- cles that are to be used for further steps.', 'The corpus may also contain meta-information, such as keywords or tagging infor- mation, provided by the authors or created by a comparison to known taxonomies, catalogs or ontologies.', 'Time stamps should also be taken into account, for example, whether they contain the publication date or the data entry date.', 'In addition, duplicates and formatting conﬂicts must be removed or har- monized.', 'For further processing, numbers and special charac- ters must be removed.', 'This includes approaches for reducing a number of words to root forms, removing program code, such as HTML syntax, or applying stop word lists.', 'The corpus should also be examined randomly for meaningfulness and gross errors.', 'For this purpose, an expert should be consulted if the reader is not an expert themselves.', 'The body of literature can also be dynamically maintained by employing alerts or monitoring.', 'If the data sets vary dynamically, an audit trail to monitor changes is mandatory.', 'Such a text corpus can also be considered as a collective reference containing the aggregated information on a subject.', 'In addition, the corpus provides an easy way for researchers to exchange scientiﬁc research results to deﬁne a common starting point.', 'E.', 'TOPIC MAPS, LATENT DIRICHLET ALLOCATION AND OTHER TOPIC-FINDING METHODOLOGIES After the corpus has been created, contents and data quality need to be reviewed.', 'This includes a rough sorting or clus- tering of the contents and can be performed using keywords or time intervals.', 'Unsupervised clustering may be useful in many cases.', 'For this purpose, we also use methodical approaches, which can be assigned to artiﬁcial intelligence.', 'The ISO standard methodology ‘‘Topic Maps’’ may help with navigating via abstracted levels and through simplifying semantic structures - a document corpus can hereby easily be mapped and searched for patterns.', 'The different topic maps vary depending on the number of articles they comprise.', 'The semantic

decades, a historical analysis is indispensable.', 'This makes it relatively easy to determine when and where the topic originated.', 'Because it is also natural for central topics to evolve semantically, system visualization can be helpful, as we will demonstrate later in this article with the topic ‘‘Data Science.’’ Some scientiﬁc statements are quickly for- gotten or are only popular for a certain period of time.', 'Through a historical analysis, the inﬂuence of classical media may also be noticed, and sometimes the thematic assessment of the nonscientiﬁc world is quite distinct from the scientiﬁc one.', 'In that way, we were able to show that the level of managerial knowledge in the environment of enterprise archi- tectures is quite different from that in science.', 'Via time series analysis throughout the complete article set, historic events can be identiﬁed, new subcategories may be determined, and future predictions can be made [65].', 'G.', 'TOPICS & TRENDS,

increased attention, more articles will be published within a given time frame and may be deﬁned as a trend.', 'Various automatic and semiautomatic text mining procedures may be applied to detect trends [66].', 'Another aspect in the prediction can be the derivation of future interests.', 'Different approaches and algorithms, such as ARIMA or ‘‘Multi-Layer Perceptron,’’ are available [68].', 'H.', 'RANKING AND VISUALIZATION OF RESULTS To investigate a ﬁeld of research, it is not the thematic analy- sis alone that is important - very often, the overall ranking of topics, journals and authors within a corpus is also a matter of weighting.', 'Which topics are published in journals with the highest impact factor?', 'Which are the most important and most frequently cited authors?', 'These are elements that are not apparent through simple reading but that can only be made visible through additional analyses or through experience and expertise.', 'However, the use of the ‘‘Journal Impact Factor’’ alone is not sufﬁcient, as Seglen has explained, since arti- cles in lesser known journals can also have a high scientiﬁc value [69].', 'Furthermore, the recitation rate is also not always meaningful on its own, since recently published articles, for example, cannot yet have high citation scores.', 'A large number of scientiﬁc publications receive no attention, as MacRoberts and

demon- strate later within this article where we map MeSH with the nomenclature of the World Health Organization (WHO).', 'In addition to quantitative characteristics, such as the number of citations, trends should be checked critically.', 'Other quali- tative characteristics can be checked with, e.g., the ‘‘C.R.A.P. Test’’ [73].', 'The background of the journal in which the publication appeared, for example, helps to classify the exact context, just as the information regarding the peer reviewers of the respective issue gives an indication of the possible focus.', 'The journal’s ranking provides further insights.', 'There are various scales, such as http://eigenfactor.org [74] or the h-index.', 'Forums such as https://pubpeer.com/ help for check- ing whether there are already ongoing critical discussions about the article in the scientiﬁc community [1].', 'The more analysis criteria are used, the more confus- ing it becomes to derive the ﬁndings.', 'For this reason, it is recommended to use a visualization technique.', 'When selecting the form of presentation, it is recommended to examine advanced alternatives in addition to classical visu- alization forms (e.g., tables, text-clusters, line / bar / pie diagrams).', 'Rekik et al., for example, used wheel graphs in their work

small study investigated how a holistic taxonomy can be created by using cluster analysis and the subsequent merging of existing taxonomies with precision/recall quality assurance.', 'For veriﬁcation of the validity of the initial systematic taxonomy taken from review articles, a comparison of existing taxonomies has been carried out using a test corpus.', 'The literature corpus is created and administered using the ‘‘SAS Content Cate- gorization Studio’’ and comprised 1,206 articles using the database ‘‘Web of Science’’ only within the research area ‘‘Business Economics.’’ To avoid falsiﬁcations by linguis- tic changes (e.g., American / British) or generalized terms (e.g., management), the taxonomies were cleaned up ﬁrst.', 'The combined systemic taxonomy taken from three review articles plus terms collected via bootstrapping achieved sig- niﬁcantly higher hit rates on the test corpus than the existing comparative taxonomies taken from the individual review articles.', 'A closer look reveals that the existing taxonomies represent, to a certain extent, the research focus of the respec- tive authors.', 'The systemic taxonomy, however, creates a generalized form that represents a higher degree of objectivity (see Figure 2).', 'As seen from the graph, the time-related analysis reveals that the existing and systemic taxonomies produce compa- rable amounts of papers

'Because supply chain management (SCM) and logistics have often been addressed alongside each other in a broad array of journals [86], we conducted a parallel in-depth analysis [87].', 'Again, we utilized the data platform ‘‘Web of Science’’ because the contents of that database are often characterized by high-quality measures and the retrieval algo- rithms that can be formulated offer a relatively high degree of ﬂexibility.', 'A more sophisticated search is possible using database portals such as ‘‘STN International.’’ We selected articles published between 2005 and 2015.', 'Although logis- tics and SCM experts were present in this study, we thor- oughly compared our results to already existing reviews; therefore, we focused on the list of relevant journals pro- vided by McKinnon (McKinnon, 2013).', 'To identify major trends, we conducted automatic classiﬁcation procedures using a mining software package (SAS Enterprise Miner) and approved the validity of four identiﬁed main trend areas (busi- ness process management, competitive advantage, strategic management, network structure) - see Figure 3.', 'By connecting these selected trends to others from our tax- onomy via semantic proximity classiﬁcation analysis (for a methodological overview, see [88]), we arrived at the follow- ing results: sustainability, information integration, Internet of things, supply chain collaboration and coordination, and inte- gration provide the highest combined visibility.', 'Operational and performance topics, such as vehicle routing, reverse logistics, purchasing and distribution, skills/competences, and organizational learning, could be identiﬁed as well.', 'A trend interaction analysis [89] reveals that the interde- pendency of logistics with collaboration and information integration plays an important role that may shortly become essential.', 'This may inﬂuence strategic perspectives on human resources and knowledge management within logistics (see, for example, [90]).', 'D.', 'TRENDS IN ENTERPRISE ARCHITECTURE MANAGEMENT In the following analysis, we originally intended to focus on enterprise architecture because it differs from the pure information technology architecture.', 'However, we noticed that many authors do not seem to be aware of these dif- ferences in nomenclature, especially in healthcare.', 'Thus, we extended our taxonomy and chose

set of sector C (diseases) of the MeSH thesaurus of 2015 into input queries to search for relevant articles – in addition, we applied a proximity operator and algorithm framework [101] to identify diseases where the sequence of words may vary (e.g., ‘‘connective tissue neoplasms’’ and ‘‘neoplasms of the connected tissue’’) or where the medical term has been intercepted by other terms

METAMORPHOSIS OF DATA SCIENCE Our ﬁnal case study in this context presents an example of using the entire workﬂow of the STIRL methodology.', 'We analyze various scientiﬁc research topics that belong to ‘‘data science’’ – we regard this term as a universal technol- ogy and methodology that includes both ‘‘big data’’ and ‘‘arti- ﬁcial intelligence’’ (among others).', 'The basics of artiﬁcial intelligence have already been presented by McCarthy et al.', 'Advances in machine learning have been published in the 1950s as well [104].', 'Both topics continued to develop – in the 1960s, similar

house technology [107].', 'Now, there are also many articles available where ‘‘Big Data’’ [21] has been mentioned as the overwhelming technology.', 'We have also noticed that authors report on

that, within the next ten years, the technologies will further merge into an all-embracing data science.', 'V.', 'DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION We apply our methodology STIRL with varying mining methods to different literature database outputs.', 'One major difference from ‘‘classical’’ review generation procedures is the taxonomy enrichment achieved both by bootstrapping and by applying natural language processing methods.', 'We apply advanced information retrieval technologies by using prox- imity and truncation operators.', 'Depending on the diversity of a topic, this may easily become much more complicated.', 'However, if the search algorithms consist only of a few basic retrieval operators, it may supersede a manual selection pro- cess.', 'In this paper, the artiﬁcial intelligence double funnel has only been applied to articles.', 'However, because we consider it principally possible and useful to also examine other big data sources with the double funnel, we have also included ‘‘big data’’ in the chart (see Figure 1).', 'To compile our methodology, we proceeded step by step as illustrated by the case studies described in this article.', 'For the', 'SAS or RapidMiner).', 'However, we also strive to map the entire process in one step using open-access tools.', 'To check the general practicability of our approach, we utilize the STIRL procedure in teaching.', 'Our students work largely independently on the various steps with their individual topics, and it appears to work for a variety of topics.', 'Within the framework of bachelor and master theses, we further develop and synthesize the technical environment such that we currently operate a one-stop shop featuring open-source tools.', 'Basically, our current system works as follows.', 'Once the user has entered speciﬁc search queries, the service automatically calls various APIs (Application Programming Interfaces), such as ScienceDirect’s, and begins the STIRL process described above.', 'Alternatively, users can also start in the middle of the process and upload a ﬁnished corpus and then choose between different analytic methods.', 'The current status of our web service ranges from preprocess- ing, such as removing stop words or lowercase and upper- case letters, calculating the inverse document frequency, Porter-, Schneeball- or Lancaster stemming methods, creat- ing clusters (user-deﬁned or calculated), to ﬁnal visualiza- tion in word clouds or graphical networks.', 'The latter can connect to the interface of the ‘‘Gephi’’ program that has been used for the visualizations presented in this article.', 'The user is able to view various graphs and tables in an overview.', 'VOLUME 7, 2019', 'To complement our procedure, we are currently developing methods with which we can generate simpliﬁed review arti- cles from the graphics or the corpus using natural language generation (NLG).', 'We hereby suggest using the following open-source building blocks:', 'The web service is a combination of different Python programs as backend services, such as Flask (1.02), ﬂask- restplus (0.12.1) and Flask-SQLAlchemy (2.3.2), as well as Ionic CLI (4.10.3) and Ionic Framework (ionic-angular 3.9.2) for the user interface.', 'For the text mining process, we have used libraries such as matplotlib (3.0.3), nltk (3.4), numpy (1.16.2), pandas (0.24.1), SpeechRecognition (3.6.3), textract (1.6.1), textstat (0.5.5) and wordcloud (1.4.0).', 'For more infor- mation, please consult https://www.elsevier.com/solutions/ sciencedirect/support/api, https://gephi.org/gephi/0.9.2/api

context of several divergent research areas.', 'STIRL appears to be applicable to generate a scientiﬁc ‘‘view beyond the horizon’’ of any subject; we also believe that the method- ology can easily be expanded to other media, such as images, sounds or video sequences; however, additional research is required to prove the general adequacy.', 'We would like to point out that our methodology is designed to be suitable for highly developed topics.', 'It is questionable, for example, whether this method is applicable to very current topics, such as blockchain, or to current developments in the ﬁeld of quantum computing.', 'Further research on the use of artiﬁcial intelligence methods on very contemporary or limited topics is deﬁnitely needed.', 'To be able to use artiﬁcial intelligence meaningfully in this context, a large amount of data should be used.', 'The research ﬁeld under investigation needs to provide dynamics and many subtopics to yield meaningful results.', 'We therefore propose limiting the STIRL procedure to research areas that have been the subject of scientiﬁc pub- lications for more than a decade and where several thou- sand publications are present.', 'However, by analyzing large literature sets with information retrieval, text mining or other artiﬁcial intelligence technologies, it should also be possible to identify neglected areas of interest.', 'To fully complete the procedure, it should also be possible to write the review article using text generation [108].', 'We are currently working on realizing this ﬁnal step.', 'REFERENCES', 'R.', 'Johnson,

of energy, water consumption, oil production, etc.), and in network parameters prediction (both transportation and web network trafﬁc prediction).', 'Data Driven Networks', 'The title of the present work refers to “data driven networks”, from the point of view of data and models used in time series forecasting.', 'Big data collection is of utmost importance to modern forecasting applications, especially for the training of efﬁcient machine learning predictive models, due to the fact that the problem of forecasting increases in complexity as the volume and dimensionality of available data sources increase.', 'In recent applications and study ﬁelds regarding time series forecasting, the collection of data relies on large-scale networks of sensors and data collection points due to the distributed nature of the target applications.', 'The analysis and forecasts based on these datasets are also fed to large-scale network applications (e.g., large-scale weather forecasts, health strategy planning on a national and global level, sales management on a global scale, etc.).', 'On the other hand, the term “data driven networks” also refers to the training and efﬁcient deployment of the models proposed for time series forecasting by the scientiﬁc community.', 'Especially in the case of machine learning models, whose application is mostly data- and problem-agnostic, data availability in sufﬁcient quantity is crucial to successful forecasting.', 'Scientiﬁc Contributions', 'The present work attempts to address the existing gap in the scientiﬁc literature, regarding an extensive summary/review of the studies comparing the application of ARIMA and machine learning techniques in time series forecasting applications.', 'This is the only such review, according to the authors’ best knowledge.', 'Our work compares time series forecasting studies across multiple applications and data sources, and it consists of mostly recent comparative studies published after 2018 (with the exception of the works of Zhang et al.', 'Nie et al.', 'Due to the multitude of different data sources and forecasting challenges, we attempt a multilateral, sampled view of the existing literature, presenting studies from ﬁve basic data categories (ﬁnan- cial, medical, weather, utilities, and network characteristics).', 'For the above reasons, our work constitutes a contemporary, multifaced, review of the existing literature comparing the ARIMA statistical approach with its machine learning counterparts.', 'Our study also summarizes the main performance metrics of the algorithms presented in each study, thus enabling an intuitive review and comparison of the methods in each forecasting application.', 'A practical evaluation (Section 5) of the studies in which the ARIMA models outperform their machine learning counterparts results in an enumeration of the application, dataset, and model-dependent characteristics that drive the choice of the optimal forecasting model in any particular application.', 'Rationale and Structure', 'The rationale behind the structure of our review is based on organizing the collected scientiﬁc literature ﬁrst in relation to the machine learning model being compared with ARIMA and second in relation to the ﬁeld of forecasting applications.', 'In that scope, the ﬁrst model category to be presented in detail is ARIMA, which is the center of our review, and then we organize the machine learning approaches by model category.', 'For each of the categories, we present the theoretical background, and then we demonstrate the relevant scientiﬁc literature organized by application category.', 'The same principle applies to the category of hybrid forecasting models, meaning the combination of ARIMA and machine', 'Future Internet 2023, 15, 255', 'Finally, we evaluate the reviewed scientiﬁc literature in total, and based on the ﬁnding that machine learning models outperform the ARIMA approach in the majority of forecasting applications, we aim to uncover the conditions under which we have a superior ARIMA forecasting result.', 'At this point, it is important to note that our work does not propose a new time series forecasting model, but rather constitutes an organized review of the published scientiﬁc literature comparing the ARIMA approach to different machine learning, and hybrid prediction models.', 'We consider this aspect of our work crucial to the feasibility of our study because we aim to compare the optimized ARIMA and machine learning models on the same datasets.', 'Therefore, although the scientiﬁc literature applying individual ARIMA or machine learning models to forecasting problems is extensive, we base our study only on the explicit comparisons of the three categories of models (ARIMA, machine learning, and hybrid).', 'The present work is organized as follows: The problem of time series forecasting, which—along with the ARIMA technique—constitutes the center of our work, is presented in Section 2, along with the morphological characteristics of the time series that affect the choice of the forecasting algorithm and their respective results.', 'A review is also carried out regarding the time series data sources and their inherent characteristics that predetermine the format of the data to be analyzed and, consequently, the choice of the forecasting algorithms.', 'In Sections 3 and 4, we perform a theoretical review of the algorithms and machine learning models that will be presented in the context of the attempted comparisons, and subsequently, we present the relevant scientiﬁc literature, organized by ﬁeld of research (ﬁnancial sector, medical care, etc.).', 'Speciﬁcally, in Section 3.1, we refer to the comparison of the SVM model with the classic ARIMA statistical technique, while in Section 3.2, the theory and applications of decision tree-based models are analyzed.', 'Section 4 presents the rationale behind the development of hybrid forecasting models with a review of the indicative scientiﬁc literature.', 'In any case, the hybrid models chosen for presentation and analysis are a combination of the ARIMA technique with a speciﬁc machine learning model.', 'Section 5 constitutes a practical evaluation of the reviewed literature, with a focus on extracting the conditions under which the ARIMA approach exhibits superior predictive performance compared with the machine learning models.', 'Finally, Section 6 covers the conclusions of our review.', 'Background: Data and Autoregressive Models 2.1. Time Series Data: Forecasting', 'Time is the central characteristic that distinguishes time series from other types of data.', 'This property of theirs is both a limitation and a structural element of the data collection, as well as a source of additional information for their analysis [6].', 'Essentially, time series data is any type of information presented as an ordered sequence and can be deﬁned as a collection of observations of some variable, organized into equally spaced time intervals [7].', 'The question of forecasting is one of the most difﬁcult and essential problems that time series analysis must deal with.', 'The performance and accuracy of the analysis results vary depending on the type of data and its assumptions.', 'In addition to these parameters, the analysis is also affected by factors inherent to the respective ﬁeld of research, such as the periodicity of the time series, unforeseen events, changes in the structure of the organizations or structures from which the data are collected, etc.', 'The “No-Free-Lunch” theorem proves that it is not possible to have a forecasting method that gives optimal performance for all possible time series [9].', 'There is a signiﬁcant amount of research literature on predictive models, and the results of these studies indicate the existence of two macro-categories of methods: statistical methods and machine learning methods.', 'In the continuation of our paper, we will refer to the following categories of time series forecasting models: (a) statistical models, (b) machine and deep learning and (c) hybrid models

Characteristics', 'Data derived from time series may have the following characteristics [6]:', 'Trend: This characteristic is associated with the presence of an upward, downward, or stable course of the series, with respect to the time dimension.', 'Seasonality: This characteristic indicates the existence of periodic patterns in the behavior of the time series, which repeat with a ﬁxed frequency.', 'Stationarity: Stationary is a time series whose statistical properties (average, variance, dispersion of values, etc.) are stable over time.', 'A stationary time series with no trend implies that its ﬂuctuations around its mean have a constant width.', 'Furthermore, the autocorrelation of static time series remains constant over time.', 'Based on these assumptions, a time series of this form can be thought of as a combination of signal and noise [11].', 'In addition to these basic characteristics, some of the more common patterns seen in', 'Cyclic behavior: In contrast to seasonal patterns, cyclical patterns appear when the factors inﬂuencing the data of each time series are not distinguished by a ﬁxed or known frequency.', 'This particular pattern mainly concerns studies related to ﬁnancial data, where cyclical behavior is observed according to the cycles of the economy and the business environment.', 'The average duration of these cycles is usually longer than the duration of seasonal patterns, of the order of two years.', 'Diurnality: Refers to the inherent patterns observed in time series originating from a particular application that have a daily or monthly repeat cycle.', 'Data related to solar, or weather observations are some examples indicating this property.', 'Outliers: Regarding the detection of anomalies and outliers in time series data, the analysis focuses on identifying abnormal changes, both desirable and undesirable, in the data set.', 'White noise: This characteristic refers to the cases where the data does not follow a', 'Time Series Data Sources', 'Time series data can come from a multitude of sources and systems with different classes of characteristics, complexity, volume, and frequency of acquisition.', 'Some categories of sources of this kind of data are industrial production, the ﬁnancial sector, the consumer electronics industry, health system structures, retail trade, meteorology, and generally any measurable and quantiﬁable manifestation of human life and its environment.', 'Especially in recent years, through the exponential growth of data sources, time series analysis and forecasting systems have been required to approach models of ever-increasing dimension and complexity.', 'Time series from complex systems capture the dynamic behavior and causes of the underlying processes and provide a practical means of predicting and monitoring the evolution of the system state.', 'However, the non-linearity and non-stationarity that of- ten characterize the underlying processes of these systems pose a strong challenge to the process of accurate prediction.', 'For most real-world systems, their dynamical state vector ﬁeld is a nonlinear function of the state variables, meaning that the relationship connecting the system’s intrinsic state variables to their autoregressive terms and exoge- nous variables is nonlinear.', 'The time series resulting from such complex systems show aperiodic (chaotic) patterns even in steady states.', 'Furthermore, since real-world systems often evolve under transient conditions, the signals obtained from them tend to exhibit various forms of non-stationarity.', 'However, the methods that dominate the literature on the analysis and forecasting of time series derived from such systems focus mainly on the forecasting of linear and static processes.', 'According to the work of Cheng et al.', 'ARIMA techniques, cannot adequately capture the evolution of these systems from the perspectives of forecasting accuracy, computational', 'Future Internet 2023, 15, 255', 'This ﬁnding prompts us to assume that the success of the used prediction method, both in the category of classical algorithms and in the category of machine learning and deep learning techniques, depends to a large extent on the complexity of the system described by the data.', 'From this point of view, artiﬁcial intelligence has an advantage over ARIMA techniques, as will be seen from the results of the studies presented later in the paper.', 'At this point, it must be mentioned that a number of non-linear transformations exist for optimizing the ARIMA models in non-linear forecasting applications, which we will refer to in the ARIMA theoretical background of our study.', 'On this note, there are a few notable exceptions where the performance of classical techniques exceeds that of artiﬁcial intelligence methods.', 'These results will be commented on in the conclusions of our research.', 'AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) Models', 'The ARIMA model is a generalization of the ARMA model (AutoRegressive Moving Average model), suitable for handling non-stationary time series.', 'As the classical ARMA model takes for granted the stationarity of the time series it is asked to analyze, the man- agement of inherently non-stationary time series requires their transformation into a static data series by eliminating seasonality and trends, through a ﬁnite-point differentiation [3].', 'As mentioned earlier, a stationary time series can be thought of as a combination of signal and noise.', 'The ARIMA model handles the time signal, after ﬁrst

is often needed to identify the best-performing ARIMA model among a number of different ARIMA (p,d,q) models for a speciﬁc forecasting application.', 'In these cases, the selection criteria include

the forecasting task under consideration, while the combination of CNN and LSTM achieves the best overall accuracy but requires more time to tune the hyperparameters.', 'Therefore, when fairly accurate forecasts and short forecast extraction times are required in a particular multivariate data set, the paper suggests the use of simple LSTM models over univariate ARIMA models.', 'Finally,

this paper argue that the SARIMA approach is more suitable for dealing with offshore wind speed forecasting because of its ability to directly support making predictions of seasonal elements on

number of nodes in each layer, the number of layers, the size of the input, the number of training epochs, the optimizer, the chosen activation function, the initialization of the kernel function, and so on.', 'Although, in recent decades, much attention has been paid to the development of suitable models to achieve accurate offshore wind speed forecasting, conventional neural networks prove to be

the best modeling features of both classical statistical algo- rithms and machine learning models, a large part of the time series forecasting scientiﬁc literature is concerned with the development of combinations of forecasting models.', 'We will initially refer to the motivations behind the development of hybrid models and, in- dicatively, emphasize some applications from various ﬁelds of research while focusing on the characteristics of the given problem and how these are modeled by the trained prediction models.', 'Hybrid time series forecasting models are developed in the scientiﬁc literature based', 'First, because of the practical difﬁculty in determining whether the time series under consideration has been produced by linear or non-linear underlying processes, as well as the difﬁculty in choosing one forecasting method over the others for a particular task and forecasting environment.', 'The usual practice to deal with this particular problem is essentially to develop, train (in the case of machine learning algorithms), and test more than one predictive model, while factors such as sampling uncertainty and the dispersion of the sampling process make it difﬁcult to generalize the chosen model.', 'Consequently, combining several algorithms to create a complex prediction model can facilitate the selection process.', 'The second reason for developing hybrid models is the fact that time series produced by real processes, in the majority of cases, do not have a purely linear or non-linear proﬁle but contain a combination of linear and non-linear patterns.', 'In these cases, single statistical or neural models are not sufﬁcient for time series modeling and forecasting since the simple version of the ARIMA model cannot deal with non-linear relationships, while the neural network model alone is not able to handle linear and non-linear patterns equally well.', 'Therefore, by combining ARIMA models with machine learning models, the complex autocorrelation structures in the data can be modeled more accurately.', 'The third factor to consider is the fact that in the scientiﬁc literature on time series forecasting, it is almost universally accepted that there is no one forecasting method that is better than all others for every forecasting situation.', 'This is largely due to the fact that a real problem is often complex in nature, and any single model may not be able to capture the different patterns equally well.', 'Therefore, the combination of different models can increase the probability of detecting different patterns in the data and improve the prediction performance.', 'In addition, the combinatorial model is more robust to a possible structural change in the data [4].', 'Regarding the combination of different forecasting algorithms in building an efﬁcient hybrid model, various workﬂows are proposed, according to the forecasting problem at hand as well as its scientiﬁc approach.', 'In the classic work by Zhang et al.', 'ARIMA and neural networks is proposed, aiming to exploit the capabilities of each model in terms of linear and non-linear modeling, respectively.', 'The proposed methodology consists of two steps: In the ﬁrst step, the ARIMA model is used to analyze the linear part of the problem, while in the second step, a neural network is developed to model the residuals of the ARIMA model.', 'Since the classical ARIMA model cannot capture the non-linear structure of the data, the residuals of the linear model will contain information about the non-linearity.', 'The outputs of the neural network can be used as predictors for the error terms of the ARIMA model.', 'The results of this research showed that the hybrid model improves the prediction accuracy of both individual models.', 'The proposed hybrid approach is presented', 'Future Internet 2023, 15, 255', 'Figure 6.', 'A similar approach is used by Biswas et al.', 'Prajapati et al.', 'Nie et al.', 'ARIMA model.', 'Figure 6.', 'Flowchart of hybrid Arima and Machine Learning model for time series forecasting.', 'This particular workﬂow is not the only one used in the scientiﬁc literature.', 'Different combinations of the ARIMA and ML

based on the RMSE and MAPE metrics, show that the performances of the four hybrid models are very close, with the best being given by the combination of ARIMA with the CNN model.', 'Another example of a hybrid model application in the ﬁnancial domain is the work by Zheng et al.', 'Weather', 'In terms of weather forecasting, research by Biswas et al.', 'The forecast is based on weather data such as

combines the advantages of ARIMA and SVMs and through the simulation of a large sample of data, the results show that this hybrid model is much better than the two forecasting models applied

from the scientiﬁc literature cited in the previ-', 'At ﬁrst, we observe that the optimal choice of a forecasting algorithm can be dif- ferent, for different versions of a dataset (e.g., different geographic regions in drought forecasting [24], different countries in modeling rates of conﬁrmed and recovered cases of COVID-19 [50]) within the same forecasting task.', 'The particular differences in the datasets’ nature, also inferred from the optimal model choice, can be of great value in a multitude of forecasting and modeling tasks and can be an important source of information for region characterization.', 'On the other hand, in some applications, it is the dataset characteristics inherent to the speciﬁc data driven network that drive the modeling choice.', 'The seasonality of the data collected (e.g., wind speed forecasting [54]), the number of target variables, as well as a multitude of underlying causes and features (e.g., forecasting the number of COVID-19 deaths [50]) can shape the nature of a forecasting application.', 'In our opinion, the system- atic characterization of applications and datasets would be of great value to modeling applications in order to fully exploit the capabilities of big data and data-driven networks.', 'The ARIMA also exhibits better predictive performance than its machine learning counterparts, in cases where the available dataset is characterized by a limited range of values or a limited time-span ([6,32,45]).', 'This observation can be attributed to the fact that machine learning, and especially deep learning models, require a large amount of data to train effectively.', 'As a result, their performance can be inferior to statistical approaches for small datasets or for short-term forecasting.', 'The algorithmic nature of the ARIMA models provides some insight into their im- plementation value in the problem of time series forecasting.', 'In comparison to complex machine learning models, ARIMA is a relatively explainable and intuitive approach that is widely used due to its ﬂexibility and reliability.', 'However, its focus on linear time de- pendencies in the data as well as its univariate modeling approach render it unsuitable for standalone application in forecasting complex real-world problems.', 'Apart from the details of the time series data, which can be a determining factor in the choice between ARIMA and machine learning models, an important aspect of the problem regards the computational and time complexity of the two approaches.', 'In the case of machine learning forecasting

learning systems can additionally estimate a probability that a document should be included (rather decision).', 'These include/exclude than probabilities rank documents from most to least relevant, thus potentially allowing the human reviewer to identify the studies to include much earlier in the screening process.', 'Following the screening, reviewers extract the data elements that are relevant to their review.', 'These are naturally viewed as individual data extraction tasks.', 'Data of interest may include numerical data such as study sample sizes and odds ratios, as well as textual data,

'Such systems typically operate over either abstracts or full-text articles and aim to extract a defined set of variables from the document.', 'At its most basic, data extraction can be seen as a type of text classification problem, in which individual words (known as tokens) are classified as relevant or not', 'Rather than translating the full document into a vector, a data extraction system might encode the word itself, plus additional contextual information (for example, nearby surrounding words and position in the document).', 'Given such a vector representation of the word at position t in

computational methods may allow new forms of synthesis unachievable manually, particu- around visualization [37, 38] and automatic larly summarization [39, 40] of large volumes of research evidence.', 'Conclusions The volume of unstructured published evidence has rendered existing (rigorous, but manual) approaches to evidence synthesis increasingly costly and impractical.', 'Consequently, researchers have developed methods that aim to semi-automate different steps of the evidence synthesis pipeline via machine learning.', 'This remains an important research direction and has the potential to dramatically reduce the time required to produce standard evidence synthesis products.', 'At the time of writing, research into machine learning for systematic reviews has begun to mature, but many barriers to its practical use remain.', 'Systematic reviews require very high accuracy in their methods, which may be difficult for automation to attain.', 'Yet accuracy is not the only barrier to full automation.', 'In areas with a degree of subjectivity (e.g. determining whether a trial is at risk of bias), readers are more likely to be reassured by the subjective but considered opinion of an expert full human versus a machine.', 'For automation remains a distant goal at present.', 'The majority of the tools we present are designed as ‘human- in-the-loop’ systems: Their user interfaces allowing human reviewers to have the final say.', 'Most of the tools we encountered were written by academic groups involved in research into evidence synthesis and machine learning.', 'Very often, these groups have produced prototype software to demonstrate a method.', 'However, such prototypes do not age well: we commonly encountered broken web links, difficult to understand and slow user interfaces, and server errors.', 'For the research field, moving from the research (e.g. RobotReviewer, available prototypes ExaCT) to professionally maintained platforms remains In our own an important problem to overcome.', 'Yet commercial software companies are unlikely to dedicate their own resources to adopting these machine learning methods unless there was a substantial demand from users.', 'Nonetheless,', 'Searching technologies', 'Users should expect to remain fully involved in each step of the review and to deal with some rough edges of the that

for screening are accessible via us- able software platforms (Abstrackr, RobotAnalyst, and EPPI reviewer) and could safely be used now as a second screener [31] or to prioritize abstracts for manual re- view.', 'Data extraction tools are designed to assist the manual process, e.g. drawing the user’s attention to rele- vant text or making suggestions to the user that they may validate, or change if needed.', 'Piloting of some of these technologies by early adopters (with appropriate methodological caution) is likely the key next step to- ward gaining acceptance by the community.', 'Endnotes',

distinguishing between legit- imate and phishing email messages.', 'This technique uses either a phishing e-mail ﬁlter, which examines and cate- gorises e-mails into their appropriate groupings, or a learning- based ﬁlter which analyses a collection of labelled coaching data (previously collected messages with upright evalua- tions) [13], [41], [42].', 'Another method of analysing e-mail messages

subject, to, and so on [42].', 'The header lines not only give information about the message’s subject, receiver, and sender, but they also give explicit routing data.', 'The body of the email follows the header lines and contributes to the message’s content.', 'Figure 4 depicts the structure of an e-mail, and Figure 5 illustrates the structure of an e-mail message for the purposes of feature

feature that is incorrectly clas- siﬁed [49].', 'The uncertainty amount that is proportional to the information gain is referred to as Entropy [49].', 'By means of these indexes, the required position of the features, either internal node or root, can be determined.', 'The decision tree can be applied to the categorical or continuous variables.', 'Instances of research in the literature using DT

a variety of decision tree classiﬁers to different sub- samples of the dataset.', 'In addition, each tree in the for- est was constructed using a random selection of the best attributes.', 'At the time of the training phase, the decision trees are created (as deﬁned by the developer), and these are applied for the class prediction use.', 'They are attained through consideration of the voted classes for each spe- ciﬁc individual tree, and the class which attains the high- est number of vote is considered the output.', 'Similar issues within literature are resolved using the RF method

this classiﬁer, and all data features are applied.', 'They are individually analysed based on the assumption that they are not only independent but also as important as one another.', 'Quick

stated by [151], aims to extract mapping from within inputs of the original dimensional space towards the devel- oped smaller dimensional space, ensuring minimum informa- tion loss [54].', 'Using the available data structure, it is possible to understand the structure and extract them through eigen- vectors and eigenvalues, which help maximise the projected data variance and spread them out over the new dimensional space [54].', 'The objective of the technique is to alter the variables that can be correlated, into the linearly uncorre- lated variables and the principal components by applying the orthogonal transformation, as stated by [152].', 'The principal component direction is represented by the eigenvectors, and the direction variance is brought forward by the eigenvalues.', 'We

selection procedure is the chi- square (χ2) [154] which assesses individual features through computation of chi-square statistics within the context of classes.', 'Hence, the chi-squared score can analyse the term and class dependency [155].', 'If the class and term are inde- pendent, then the score would be 0 otherwise 1 [155].', 'The score is informed depending on the term having a high chi- square.', 'We observed that some studies, e.g., [54], [153] have used the Chi-Square in phishing email detection.', 'MUTUAL INFORMATION/INFORMATION GAIN The measure used for the quantiﬁcation of

then decided, and the attributes are kept with a value attached—only the top-ranked ones are kept.', 'Furthermore, the features are selected by information gain through scores.', 'Such a technique

relevant evaluation metrics is an essential aspect with which to reckon.', 'There are some grounds on which accuracy is unsuitable, for instance, asymmetric costs, base-rate fallacy, and imbalanced datasets.', 'The same situation is seen with the ErR metric and in this plan, the preferential values should be the confusion matrix, ROC, and AUC.', 'In addition, the metrics particularly sug- gested for imbalanced investigations must be utilised by the researchers [165], for instance, balanced accuracy, Matthews correlation coefﬁcient (MCC), geometric mean, and bal- anced detection rate, and others.', 'Although, certain papers utilise greatly imbalanced URL datasets, [166], [167], error rates [117], [125], make use of detection rates and malicious missing rates [168], and employ metrics in demand such as recall, -score, accuracy, precision, and ROC [169] utilising FP and FN rates, when the class grouping and dataset size is recorded, they can have an advantage of working out

algorithms including NB and SVM.', 'The employment of unsupervised and semi-supervised system is expected to bring a revolution in the world of phishing detection.', 'Interestingly, every algorithm has its own areas of application from the advanced SVM algorithm to the basic Naïve Bayes algorithm.', 'The core of Machine Learning based models may contain a single algorithm, or even multiple algo- rithms.', 'Appendix Table  indicates that there are way more multi-algorithm-based frameworks than the single algorithm models.', 'The future research is also required to investigate the hybrid systems in detail.', 'To enhance the performance of the classiﬁers, opti- misation algorithms have been used in several stud- ies: [47], [52], [57], [59], [68], [70], [102], [105], [115], [126], [127], and the most important of them is the bio- inspired computing (BIC) optimisation technique [185].', 'The attributes of self-correction and enhancement are inherent in Bioinspired computing (BIC) algorithms, along with a natural tendency to adjust according to the consistently changing environments.', 'BIC is capable of offering ﬂexible, efﬁcient and multifaceted computational algorithms.', 'BIC algorithms have been used in different ﬁelds in the past few years to solve issues.', 'BIC solution can be obtained by selecting appropriate dimensions of the problem, assessing the signiﬁcance of the', 'Research is being carried out on BIC processes to resolve complicated computational problems [186].', 'Figure 14 represents a bar chart', 'In short, Figure 14 implies the preference of the researchers and system developers to make use of supervised approaches which indicates extensive scope of conducting further research on semi-supervised, unsupervised and rein- forcement based models in context of phishing [44]–[64], [66], [70], [77]–[82], [84]–[99], [101], [102], [105]–[112], [115]–[128], [131], [132], [153], [164], [196]–[198].', 'Experts interested in developing anti-phish systems based on Arti- ﬁcial Intelligence must understand that only unsupervised Machine learning can render the desired outcomes; hence, more research is required to get complete insight into unsu- pervised ML.', 'A comparison of supervised and unsuper- vised ML techniques shows that the scope of the latter is broader than the former since non-supervised phishing detec- tion frameworks can outperform the supervised ML-based counterparts if properly applied and exploited.', 'This may be attributed to certain features of unsupervised learning that make it a better choice in comparison to supervised learn- ing.', 'These features include easier computations and eas- ier accessibility to unlabeled data as compared to labeled data.', 'Figure 21 shows 91 studies that involved the use of ML algorithms during the development of phish detection sys- tems.', 'The data revealed that header or domain features (exclu- sive of subject ﬁeld) were employed in just 29% of these studies (i.e. 27 studies).', 'This indicates the need for more diligent analysis of e-mail with respect to header, domain and URL-based features.', 'Moreover, only the set of selec- tive features have been employed in the frameworks with no consideration to some essential features like ‘Received from,’ header ﬁelds, ‘Age of domain’ and others.', 'Hence, it is imperative to consider using the overlooked header, URL and domain features in future in phish detection frameworks dur- ing the implementation of feature engineering for developing a competent feature set.', 'Usually, the word-based clustering or classiﬁcation models are used in the studies investigating e-mail phish detection.', 'The phish is detected on the basis of the similarity of the mod- els and clusters with common phish words.', 'Despite the logic behind these models and clusters, it is not easy to prevent phishing since the phishers have also become more robust and they tend to design their phishing content and emails with due consideration to all the security techniques and approaches and the psychology of internet users.', 'Usually, the phishers design their phishing content by including words and phrases relevant to ﬁnance and other interesting subjects in the message body.', 'They speciﬁcally tend to design the ‘Sub- ject’ header in such a way that the users become compelled', 'VOLUME 10, 2022', 'S.', 'Salloum et al.: Systematic Literature Review on Phishing Email Detection Using NLP Techniques', 'This implies that phishing email detection through content analysis or normal word-based analysis can be made more effective by using automated mechanism for timely detection of phishing emails.', 'The automated mecha- nism allows identifying the similarity between the email and the structure explained earlier in Figure 3.', 'After checking for similarities, the automated mechanism tags the email as either phishing or legitimate.', 'There is a dearth of recent studies on the use of such an automated mechanism while applying con- tent based analysis techniques.', 'Hence, future research must be performed to explore this undiscovered subject of content analysis (including subject header).', 'This also suggests that an effective ML based framework for phishing detection must be competent enough to identify phisher and fraudsters despite all the mentioned challenges.', 'The earlier research can serve as the guideline for researchers interested in exploring this domain in future.', 'The last decade showed considerable rise in the num- ber of studies published annually; the stats indicated in Figure 22 shows that there was only one research article published in 2006 while the following ten years showed an average of 4 research articles on an annual basis.', 'The growing interest of researchers in this domain is expected to result in emergence of better and novel techniques for phishing detec- tion.', 'Moreover, with the outbreak of the Corona pandemic in 2019 and 2020, the phishing attacks were on peak and hence, the years 2019 and 2020 depicted a signiﬁcant rise in the number of research articles published in this domain.', 'Since the month of September, the next year, a number of researchers started their studies on Phishing attacks in con- text of coronavirus disease (COVID-19).', 'Generally, phishers use texts relevant to COID-19 pandemic or about internet technologies and security to attract their victims and conduct Phishing attacks [1].', 'The collected data revealed signiﬁcant rise in the number of phishing attacks being made and a consequent elevation in the losses being caused by phishing activities.', 'Appendix Table  indicates the inclination of the scholars towards the use of the popular NLP technique (e.g., Lexical analysis, POS, NER, tagging, language detection and identiﬁcation of semantic relationships, Char-level email (header & body), word-level email (header & body) in context of phishing [49], [51], [63], [64], [78], [80]–[82], [89], [109].', 'One of the most popular databases that entail signiﬁcant research works pertaining to phishing email detection is none other than Google Scholar depicted in Figure 10.', 'Next in the line are databases like Springer, IEEE, ScienceDirect, ACM Digital Library, Wiley Online Library, SAGE Pub, Emerald, and Taylor and Francis Online databases.', 'All the mentioned databases are highly known for entailing compe- tent research works associated with phishing email detection.', 'The researches included in the databases also shed light on various NLP techniques and their use with regards to phishing detection.', 'These databases can prove helpful for scholars in extracting relevant studies about phishing e-mail detection while conducting research in future.', 'Speciﬁcally, including the feature selection techniques, the current paper provides critical investigations of the study regarding phishing email detection techniques.', 'It also demon- strates the weak points linked to every included research.', 'Moreover, it enlightens the ML classiﬁers, including their correlated features selection technique, which is stated in the research.', 'The results of the included research study have been considered with regards to several factors, and these factors are the approval of redundant or independent features, value diverseness, feature hybridity, high dimensionality in data, imbalanced data and the performance outlined through the features for the detection of unfamiliar types of phishing attacks included in web data.', 'Additionally, through imple- menting an extra feature, it will become feasible to assist the choice of most applicable feature/features as discovered from this review; this can effortlessly avoid the problem discussed earlier.', 'However, a limited quantity of applicable redundant features can be implemented alongside the extra feature to detect phishing, which can consequently provide improved selection outcome.', 'Thus, the possibility of imbal- anced dataset selection is reduced in addition, with a fair decrease in dataset dimensionality.', 'It is considered that when the classiﬁcation is speciﬁc, operating duration is lesser, easier estimations can be made, with least storage and errors and false detection related cost being less as well, as these can allow a phishing detection to be effective.', 'Therefore, it can be seen that the proposal of utilising an extra feature can be emphasised in future research, along with the advantages associated with these features at the time of detection of a hybrid phishing email.', 'To restrict the activity of phishers, it is crucial that at the time of performing research in the future, one should take into consideration the view of attackers or phishers in regards with the phishing issues, along with phishers’ emotions and their aims.', 'As stated by Haskin et al.', 'NNs were seen as a good tool for detecting phishing attacks, however it can be a poor choice in terms of phishing detection due to the features of detailed training needs along with speciﬁc skills vital for parameter tuning.', 'The ML tech- niques are also reckoned by the experts for detecting phishing attacks.', 'Furthermore, failing to notice the phishing attacks developed via procedure such as squatting, tab-napping and malvertising, it was seen that the number of research studies carried out in the domain of avoiding phishing and detection procedures were usually on the subject found in the message of phishing e-mails.', 'Nonetheless, to detect and resolve phish- ing emails appropriately, the research these days examine the production of the NLP technique, and by employing semantic change, the phishing can be observed via NLP.', 'In addition, even though NLP is not tested on huge datasets as yet, as per the research, it is identiﬁed as having good precision in contrast with different techniques of detecting phishing emails [46].', 'When conducting research in the future, the', 'VOLUME 10, 2022', 'S.', 'Salloum et al.: Systematic Literature Review on Phishing Email Detection Using NLP Techniques', 'The emphasis of researchers on non-semantic feature analysis till date, even though they are not related to identifying the sender’s aim, must be rectiﬁed.', 'The work is made more complex by selected phishing emails being falsiﬁed by the phishers for instance; spear-phishing or whaling by utilising personal information gathered from social networking sites (SNS).', 'The detection system that relies on listing or malware analysis in regards to detecting the emails ﬁnds it difﬁcult to work in areas without attachments or links.', 'The need to extract the deﬁnition of the body content of an email is required at the time of beginning intention analysis.', 'Fur- thermore, for the email content to be semantically prepared, the addition of semantic in the research is needed; this way, the detection aim can be obtained.', 'An attentive research is required to be performed, so that it brings out indications and expressions from the email body text in order to control the phishing problems.', 'A semantic analysis should be made of the email body text and the features, for instance, sentences and words, must be used to identify the legitimacy of the email.', 'Most of the procedures linked with the detection of phish- ing emails generally uses the ML techniques, speciﬁcally classiﬁcation and clustering.', 'Therefore, ML-based evaluation metrics and approaches are utilised by these techniques.', 'The evaluation results can fall to disuse in the long-term, due to the constant developing character of phishers.', 'Consequently, the complexity of the cybersecurity domain is increased.', 'Nonetheless, this issue can be controlled if the evolving of evaluation results is given particular heed.', 'The experts linked to phishing detection must attempt and devise adaptable eval- uation plans that can be amended when needed to ensure cybersecurity.', 'In this way, it will be easier to prevent the drawbacks such as inadequate time validity and range.', 'Thus, in this respect, there are several classiﬁcations of the dataset that have been developed by researchers and specialists that depend on the type of the related dataset, and time and place, and only then can the research on every class of the dataset begin.', 'The accurate contrast of several phishing detection techniques is hard to produce because of the lack of basic benchmarks.', 'Moreover, this is high time for the researchers to constantly try and devise plans that can reduce the negative impact of the above-mentioned problems related to phishing detection techniques.', 'This is because inconsiderate giving out of sensitive data along with evolution of phishers, result in the non-availability of reference datasets.', 'This systematic review is limited in the sense that it has only included research studies extracted from speciﬁc databases (like The ACM Digital Library, Emerald, Google Scholar, IEEE, ScienceDirect, Springer, Taylor and Francis Online, and Wiley Online Library).', 'Consequently, there is probability that the included databases may fail to fully repre- sent content entailed in missed studies relevant to the topic of', 'NLP Techniques used for phishing detection.', 'It is possible to rectify this lim- itation in future research through the inclusion of databases like Web of Science, Scopus, ERIC, ProQuest that have not been considered in this study.', 'VI.', 'CONCLUSION Presently, one of the most interesting topics in the domain of cybersecurity is assumed to be phishing email detec- tion.', 'In this research, journal, conference, and workshop papers were carefully analysed, published between 2006 and 2022, with different techniques to investigate the trend of phishing email detection.', 'A systematic literature review was employed to select 100 publications.', 'All types of phishing email detection, for example, ‘the domain name is misspelt,’ ‘the email is poorly written,’ ‘suspicious attachments or links’ and ‘phishing warning messages,’ have been covered in our research.', 'The background information regarding the phishing ecosystem is ﬁrst presented along with the valuable phishing statistics.', 'Next, the taxonomy of phishing detection schemes are then stated, and the phishing email detection datasets and phishing email detection features are discussed along with the detection algorithms and evaluation metrics.', 'Lastly, recommendations are presented which can help with the phishing detection schemes’ effective development, so that the compare-and-contrast schemes can be easily carried out.', 'This survey is unique in the sense that it relates work to their openly available tools and resources.', 'The analysis of the presented work revealed that not much had been discussed about phishing email detection using NLP tech- niques.', 'Therefore, many open issues are associated with this phishing email detection.', 'An evolving research area is illustrated by this phishing email detection.', 'However, all the presented resources are not publicly available so far.', 'Various research questions arise with this survey: (1) Is manually built resource-effective, or is it better to suggest techniques to automatically produce such resources?', 'Why do the research studies always follow the way of construction?', 'Can we depend on the existing resources to combine resources, etc.?', 'Are deep learning approaches more help- ful and time-saving as compared to conventional approaches such as NB, SVM, etc., for phishing email detection?', 'Considering the outcomes of the systematic literature review, it is observed that phishing email detection is con- sidered as the main research ﬁeld, and research community has tried hard to address this problem in various common languages like English.', 'Yet, it hasn’t been possible to gener- alize those ﬁndings to the rest of the cultures or environments like the developing non-English-speaking nations, where the Arab world is no exception.', 'Arabic language is considered to be a Semitic language attributed with rich morphology.', 'This aids in our motivation towards the problem of Arabic language phishing emails for the removal of language bar- riers.', 'There are very few papers on Arabic spam/phishing email detection on classical machine learning [112].', 'Due to a lack of resources for Arabic spam/phishing emails and the', 'VOLUME 10, 2022', 'S.', 'Salloum et al.: Systematic Literature Review on Phishing Email Detection Using NLP Techniques', 'Arabic NLP in general, studies on Arabic phishing email detection are insufﬁcient.', 'Offering the latest resources and tools to the community of research is the key idea of this survey.', 'The overall objective is to present the strengths and weaknesses of each resource to the community.', 'It is evident that after 2019, there has been a dramatic upsurge in the number of deep learning techniques adopted by researchers in the phishing email detection.', 'The ﬁndings revealed that further work is required to employ modernised, deep learning techniques in phishing email detection studies; for instance, long-short-term mem- ory (LSTM) and CNN models.', 'The tools and resources are not sufﬁcient in this research area.', 'Hence, the researchers are in dire need to perform more research to assess deep learning techniques in the phishing email detection domain.', 'The steady performance of the model was the reason for the great acceptance of supervised approaches, as various distinct observations – particularly in the ﬁeld of machine learning-based proposal – were seen from the outcome of the study, after its detailed investigation.', 'Moreover, as outlined, there are some algorithms which have signiﬁcant require- ments, for instance NB and SVM.', 'Also, the bio-inspired computing (BIC) optimisation technique has been used in several studies and has signiﬁcantly improved the perfor- mance of classiﬁers and reduced security challenges related to costs of misclassiﬁcation as well as user-dependent costs of misclassiﬁcation.', 'Summing up, we have seen that the most commonly utilised are single-algorithm anti-phish systems, for this rea- son the possibility of analysis into hybrid and multi-algorithm systems is fairly positive.', 'Apart from the research which emphasises on email header features, except for the URLs in the email body, subject ﬁeld and sender domain data must be greatly considered going forward.', 'Furthermore, the presen- tation of ‘Concept Drift’ is an essential ﬁeld that could con- tribute to improving methods for detecting phishing attacks.', 'A fresh concept that is used is social honeypots and recom- mendation system algorithms, which are used for: detection of phishing that occurs between two malicious proﬁles and also for the detection of similar phishing emails.', 'Through this method, the detection of phishing emails occurs more rapidly.', 'However, there is a need for some innovative ideas that can consider each perspective of an issue, as the recent method has not proven as effective in regards to managing phishing emails nature.', 'Even governments of many notable countries around the world, despite being reproached by several bodies have failed to produce an efﬁcient procedure that has a long-term inﬂuence on this problem.', 'Having said that, it is seen lately that a greater signiﬁcance is given to invigorate cybersecurity’ consequently, a rise in research and fair accessibility of funds in this area have also been observed.', 'Therefore, it is anticipated that a tough framework, set up with actions opposed to the pitfalls outlined in this work can be made accessible for both individual and commercial implementations.',

      "14 Historically, summaries of scientiﬁc evidence have helped discover patterns of phenomena, develop theories or concepts, and  inform practice.\n",
      "15 Although common with editors and readers alike, this approach is less rigorous since evidence summarized this way  is less likely to answer speciﬁc clinical questions and more likely to contain literature selected by the authors and recommendations  prejudiced strongly by opinion.\n",
      "16 With exponential growth in scientiﬁc literature, the search for a structured and eﬀective evidence  synthesis has become a critical scientiﬁc endeavor.\n",
      "17 Evidence synthesis involves combining information from multiple studies or  research that have investigated the same or similar issue to come to a conclusive understanding of a speciﬁc topic [1] .\n",
      "18 It often  involves summarizing trends, identifying emerging questions, and clarifying disagreements and conﬂicting results [ 2 , 3 ].\n",
      "19 Since 1753 when James Lind published the ﬁrst evidence synthesis to provide a concise and unbiased summary of evidence  on scurvy, improvement in the state of evidence synthesis has grown [ 4 , 5 ].\n",
      "20 In the past two decades, advances in computer-aided  technology have enabled the growth and development of various forms of evidence synthesis.\n",
      "21 The two central techniques known  to have originated from the medical sciences and are commonly used today to synthesize evidence are systematic reviews (SRs) – which search available literature for evidence that addresses the research question, - and meta-analyses – which quantitatively assess  statistical evidence found through systematic reviews [5] .\n",
      "22 Evolutionary and behavioral ecologists started adopting meta-analyses  in the mid-1990s and became fully embraced since 2010 [6] .\n",
      "23 Meta-analysis has since become the gold standard for combining  information from multiple studies across disciplines.\n",
      "24 However, a good meta-analysis is dependent on a good sampling of the core  universe of studies, thus requiring a careful and comprehensive SR.\n",
      "25 A SR involves the review of an articulated research question  using systematic and testable methods to help to identify, select and evaluate all pertinent research [7] , and collect and analyze data  from the studies that are included in the review [8] .\n",
      "26 An excellent SR assembles and presents an impartial and objective summary of  ﬁndings, assesses all results for inclusion/exclusion and quality, and minimizes bias at all stages of the process [7] .\n",
      "27 However, the process of evidence synthesis is very tedious and often involves experienced methodologists and disciplinary experts  combing through all relevant studies, both published and unpublished, through a guided methodological process.\n",
      "28 As such, it tends  to be costly and tedious as it can take months, or even years, to complete, making it practically challenging [9] .\n",
      "29 According to  some estimates, conducting a SR can take up to 2 years to complete.\n",
      "30 SR with  meta-analyses ranges from 216 to 2,518 hours.\n",
      "31 According to [11] , conducting an eﬀective systematic search requires an information  specialist’s expertise and time, who need an average aggregated time of 26.9 hours when developing a search strategy.\n",
      "32 Thus, the  design and implementation of evidence-based synthesis are hampered by high ﬁnancial costs [3] and signiﬁcant time commitment  [2] .\n",
      "33 To overcome time and resource constraints required to synthesize evidence, scholars have adopted automation of the laborious  tasks in SR [12] .\n",
      "34 Advances in computer-aided technology have helped automate aspects of the evidence synthesis process to improve  eﬃciency and cut costs and time while still maintaining the standards of conventional search methods [13] .\n",
      "35 Automation occurs  in diﬀerent forms; from the most basic of tasks to complicated ones [13] , such as removing duplicate articles, prioritizing articles  for screening, and extracting data from tables and ﬁgures [ 14 , 15 ].\n",
      "36 Research on diﬀerent approaches for automating systematic  reviews via technologies such as machine learning, text mining, and natural language processing exists [12] .\n",
      "37 Text mining is the  process of discovering knowledge and structure from unstructured data [16] , while Natural Language Processing (NLP) supports  human analysts to carry out various linguistic analytical tasks on textual documents [17] , such as identifying potential keywords in  systematic literature reviews [18–20] .\n",
      "38 Using NLP to extract information from text automatically leads to decreased labor of manual  extraction from a large volume of text material and saves time [21] .\n",
      "39 However, automation in SR has focused chieﬂy on extracting data or results after a literature search, while methods or strategies  to ﬁnd or assemble all relevant evidence, including developing a search strategy, have received little attention [22] .\n",
      "40 According to  [22] , search strategies for SR should be able to return all the studies relevant to the review (‘recall’) without retrieving irrelevant  studies (‘precision’).\n",
      "41 Unfortunately, not all ﬁelds of study have a structured or standardized ontology for search strategy development.\n",
      "42 The ﬁeld of public health has institutionalized support and standardized ontology (i.e., Medical Subject Headers, or MeSH) for search  strategy development [23] .\n",
      "43 However, ecology or environmental sciences, generally, does not have standardized ontologies.\n",
      "44 Thus,  researchers tend to use broad, non ‐speciﬁc keywords in their search (Pullin & Stewart, 2006), leading to low precision of search  results (0.473%; [2] ).\n",
      "45 With low precision, more time and cost are spent on screening articles.\n",
      "46 Thus, enhanced standardization in search  strategy development is critical to improving the speciﬁcity, objectivity, and reproducibility of SRs [24] .\n",
      "47 Two primary approaches  for automating search strategy development are citation networks and text mining [22] ; both use a set of predetermined articles that  researchers deem relevant to the review.\n",
      "48 Thus, both approaches require researchers to select a starting set of articles with which they \n",
      "49 This predisposes citation networks and text mining towards familiar articles.\n",
      "50 Although this approach has high  precision, it has a low recall, and the risk of selection, citation, and publication bias is increased as the initial set of articles inﬂuences  what is eventually retrieved [ 25 , 22 , 26 ].\n",
      "51 In this research, we mediate the problems associated with search strategy development in systematic literature reviews by devel-  oping a method that uses NLP and keyword co-occurrence networks to identify potential keywords to support SR.\n",
      "52 We adapted the  search terms strategy for naïve search proposed by [22] written in R.\n",
      "53 To facilitate reproducibility and transparency; we created the  python package dubbed ‘Ananse’ (a Ghanaian vernacular translated as a spider) to aid the implementation of the method in a user-  friendly format.\n",
      "54 We tested  our approach by applying it to selecting keywords for a systematic literature review of cumulative eﬀect assessment of disturbance  on forest ecosystems (see [30] ).\n",
      "55 The remainder of the study is structured as follows.\n",
      "56 Materials and methods are presented in section 2 , where the process ﬂow  of Ananse in ﬁnding search terms are described.\n",
      "57 Using Ananse to perform a search tailored to a SR of cumulative eﬀect studies is  described in section 3 .\n",
      "58 In section 4 , we discuss the outcomes of using Ananse to perform cumulative eﬀect search terms [30] and  compare our results with other related works.\n",
      "59 Finally, in section 5 , we draw conclusions based on our ﬁndings and forecast future  work.\n",
      "60 We developed a Python package to partially automate search term selection and write search strategies for SRs. We refer to this  Python package as Ananse (a Ghanaian vernacular translated as a spider).\n",
      "61 We adapted the search strategy for black-backed woodpecker  occupancy of post-ﬁre forest systems ( [22] and [31] ) written in R.\n",
      "62 Our search term selection strategy focuses on cumulative eﬀect and  seeks to create an open-source search software in Python.\n",
      "63 Software design describes the structure of the software to be implemented, the data models used by the system, the interfaces,  and, sometimes, the algorithms used [32] .\n",
      "64 Requirements usually precede the design.\n",
      "65 We present the following design considerations  during the creation of Ananse: functional requirements, use case diagram, and data ﬂow diagram.\n",
      "66 We do not intend to oﬀer a technical  software engineering perspective but to guide the user to appreciate the design concepts which gave birth to Ananse.\n",
      "67 The functional requirements for a software system describe what the system should do [ 33 , 34 ].\n",
      "68 We considered the SR process \n",

      "95 The authors,  who are experts in the domain of cumulative eﬀect assessment, developed the initial search terms (76 search terms) under diﬀerent  concept categories to guide the identiﬁcation of studies for the naïve search.\n",
      "96 We grouped the search terms into three concept categories  and combined them into a Boolean search (see Table 1 ).\n",

      "102 Due to the diﬀerent formats in the exportation of results from the databases, this manual process takes  more time.\n",
      "103 All these three ﬁles were fed into Ananse at the same time.\n",

      "110 Provided that the path  to the directory of search results is given, the import_naive_results function in Ananse automatically ﬁnds each ﬁle’s database and ﬁle  type, selects analogous columns, and joins them to form a single dataset.\n",

      "114 If save_dataset is set to TRUE while the parameter save_directory is set to the directory of choice, the merged ﬁle is saved to that  directory path containing the naive search results ﬁles.\n",
      "115 After the results are obtained, a pandas data frame consisting of assembled  search results is returned.\n",
      "116 After the merging, Ananse performs deduplication based on the article titles and abstracts and returns  diﬀerent articles.\n",

      "123 Extracting and identifying keywords \n",
      "124 Ananse uses the Rapid Automatic Keyword Extraction (RAKE) [35] , a keyword extraction method, to extract potential keywords  from the titles, keywords and abstracts of articles in the deduplicated dataset.\n",
      "125 The RAKE is designed to identify keywords in sci-  entiﬁc literature by selecting strings of words uninterrupted using a list of stopwords (6 + ) and phrase delimiters (punctuation) to  detect the most relevant words or phrases in a piece of text [36] .\n",
      "126 The function extract_terms call the RAKE algorithm and eliminates  keywords that only appear in a single article and excludes phrases with only one word from the list of potential keywords result-  ing in a more precise search.\n",
      "127 Ananse then combines the author- and database-tagged keywords with the search terms.\n",
      "128 The author  and database tagged keywords are combined as dictionary objects created with extract_terms to deﬁne all possible keywords.\n",
      "129 All the  possible keywords are then passed to a function create_dtm for function wrapping, which generates a document-feature matrix using  the potential keywords as features and the combined titles, abstracts, and keywords of each article (also referred to as noted) as the  documents.\n",
      "130 The selection of keywords using the frequency of occurrence can be a good indicator of the relevance of a word/term to a search  strategy.\n",
      "131 However, we moved beyond this and generated a keyword co ‐occurrence network.\n",
      "132 The co-occurrence network creates and  measures each term’s importance and inﬂuence in relation to the topic being reviewed [37] .\n",
      "133 Using the document matrix containing  the potential keywords, we generated a keyword co-occurrence network.\n",
      "134 Each keyword is represented by a point referred to as the  node, and an edge also represents a link between the keywords.\n",
      "135 Each node represents a potential search term, and the edges are co-  occurrences of two terms in a study’s title, abstract, or tagged keywords [37] .\n",
      "136 In Ananse , the co-occurrence network is implemented  with the function create_network, which measures the importance of each term in relation to the selected topic being reviewed.\n",
      "137 The function get_centrality is used to evaluate the node importance of a graph and returns a dictionary containing nodes with their  importance.\n",

      "141 Important  nodes  represent  keywords  to  be  used  to  generate  ﬁnal  search  terms.\n",
      "142 Two  methods  to  identify  impor-  tant  nodes  were  explored  in  Ananse :  ﬁtting  a  spline  model  to  the  node  importance  to  select  tipping  points  and  cu-  mulative  approach,  which  ﬁnds  the  minimum  number  of  nodes  to  capture  a  large  percentage  of  the  total  impor-  tance  of  the  network.\n",
      "143 One  can  decide  which  method  to  use  depending  on  the  distribution  and  preference.\n",
      "144 In  choos-  ing  a  method,  the  ﬁrst  thing  to  do  is  to  look  at  the  distribution  of  node  importance.\n",
      "145 In  Ananse,  the  distribu-  tion  was  plotted  with  the  function  plot_degree_distribution,  plot_rank_degree_distribution,  or  plot_degree_histogram  as  shown  in  Fig.\n",
      "146 A spline model for ﬁnding cut-oﬀ is an appropriate method to identify the cut-oﬀ threshold for keyword importance if the rank  distribution plot has a lot of weak nodes with a long tail.\n",
      "147 On the other hand, the cumulative approach is more appropriate when  there are no clear breaks in the data.\n",
      "148 In Ananse, the ﬁnd_cutoﬀ function ﬁnds the cut-oﬀ for a graph network using either cumulative  or spline method of cutting the degree distribution, as shown in Fig.\n",
      "149 The reduce_graph function then generates a graph consisting  of only important nodes, after which the get_keyword function extracts the keywords from the reduced network.\n",
      "150 Ananse uses the node strength to generate relevant keywords from which the experts can now select their ﬁnal keywords.\n",
      "151 In  this research, Ananse generated 4,596 keywords.\n",
      "152 A screenshot of it is shown in Fig.\n",
      "153 Afterward, the researchers manually reviewed each word or phrase using their expert knowledge to arrive at the ﬁnal  keywords.\n",
      "154 The ﬁnal list of search terms (listed as search strings) was grouped under three concepts, as shown in Table 2 .\n",
      "155 Evidence synthesis has become an essential feature of the current academic landscape, although a lack of transparency often  hampers the process.\n",
      "156 This research reports on the methods used to select search terms that form the building block for performing  evidence synthesis and oﬀers a transparent approach to understand underlying assumptions.\n",
      "157 In systematic reviews, the selection of  key search terms is considered the basic building block for the successful assemblage of knowledge in a particular ﬁeld.\n",
      "158 However, this  process is often left to researchers’ discretion, leaving room for biases and a subjective selection process, aﬀecting the outcomes of  eﬀective evidence synthesis.\n",
      "159 In this research, we designed and implemented a partially automated keyword search software package  using Python for SR to enhance eﬃciency, maximize transparency and comprehensiveness while minimizing subjectivity and bias.\n",
      "160 Dubbed Ananse , our tool provides an eﬃcient and standardized method for developing search strategies using NLP and co-occurrence  networks to identify relevant search terms.\n",
      "161 Our approach combines expert knowledge with a quasi ‐automated method which enhances search recall.\n",
      "162 This is very important  for ﬁelds such as ecology, where non ‐standardized or nuanced terminology or a lack of formal ontologies exist for conducting SRs  [22] .\n",
      "163 Most importantly, Ananse signiﬁcantly reduces the time required to conduct a SR by decreasing time spent on search strategy  development and tedious tasks like assembling and deduplication.\n",
      "164 Compared with the manual process of assembling results, Ananse  reduced by more than half the time required to assembly results.\n",
      "165 Similarly, while it took two of the co-authors two days of full-time  work to remove duplicates, Ananse removed the duplicates eﬃciently in about a minute or less and achieved 100% accuracy.\n",
      "166 With  the reduction in time needed to develop a search strategy and assemble and deduplicate the results, our approach makes extensive  systematic reviews and meta ‐analyses more eﬃcient and eﬀective compared with conventional approaches.\n",
      "167 Our research contributes  to the emergence and application of an ever-growing set of tools and software that can be used to facilitate transparent, reproducible  reviews and develop reproducible synthesis workﬂows such as metaDigitise [38] , litsearchr [22] in R, and revtools [39] .\n",
      "168 These eﬀorts  should help facilitate the reproducibility of ecological reviews, enhance transparency, and improve the rigor of evidence used to guide  policy decisions [40] .\n",
      "169 In its current implementation , Ananse, a Python package, contains a suite of functions to improve the eﬃciency of keywords  selection for systematic reviews.\n",
      "170 For instance, by automatically deduplicating and assembling results from separate databases, Ananse  provides a systematic approach to facilitate knowledge synthesis through SR.\n",
      "171 Also, apart from generating keywords, it can act as  middleware or a data converter for integrating multiple datasets into a database.\n",
      "172 Done manually, this is a time ‐intensive process \n",
      "173 because platforms and databases export results in diﬀerent formats [2] .\n",
      "174 Furthermore, we used the agile method of software engineering  with open-source software development, thereby making Ananse easily customizable and improved upon as researchers use it beyond  the application to cumulative eﬀects assessments.\n",
      "175 Currently, Ananse has a popularity of 131 downloads per week on the Python  Package Index ( https://snyk.io/advisor/python/ananse ).\n",
      "176 Ananse contributes to the development of open-source software systems  needed to speed up systematic review.\n",
      "177 In its current state, Ananse provides a means to merge and deduplicate keywords for experts  programmatically.\n",
      "178 By its design and implementation, Ananse allows researchers to modify their requirements without creating new  software.\n",
      "179 Even though Ananse has been used for a cumulative eﬀect use case [30] , it is general-purpose software for a systematic  review of any kind.\n",
      "180 It can be applied broadly in ecology and evolutionary biology as well as other ﬁelds.\n",
      "181 Compared to conventional approaches for developing keywords for systematic review, our method is far eﬀective and eﬃcient by  signiﬁcantly reducing the time and resources needed to develop search strategies to conduct systematic reviews.\n",
      "182 Ananse substantially  reduces the time spent on the systematic review by automating time-consuming tasks such as assembling and deduplicating large  search results.\n",
      "183 Ananse saves time and enhances eﬀective keyword generation compared to traditional methods by automating the  tedious and bias-prone aspect of systematic review tasks.\n",
      "184 Therefore, Ananse presents an approach to performing large systematic  reviews within a short period of time.\n",
      "185 Our results can be used as a starting point to frame future studies according to well-deﬁned terminology.\n",
      "186 Future research would  enhance the front-end of Ananse through a user-friendly graphical interface.\n",
      "187 Currently, Ananse allows one user per time; this func-  tionality can be improved by making Ananse a server-type software with capabilities to permit concurrent and multi-user interaction.\n",

Data management solutions on their own are becoming  very expensive and  not able to cope with the reality of everlasting data complexity. Businesses have grown  more sophisticated in their use of data, which drives new demands that require different  ways to handle this data. Forward thinking organizations believe that the only way to  solve the data problem will be the implementation of an effective data governance. At- tempts in governing data failed before, as they were driven by IT, and affected by rigid  processes and fragmented activities carried out on system by system basis. Up to very  recently governance is mostly informal with very ambiguous and generic regulations, in  siloes around specific enterprise repositories, lacking structure and the wider support of  the organization. Despite its highly recognized importance, the area of data governance  is still under developed and under researched. Since data governance is still under re- searched, there is need to advance research in data governance in order to deepen prac- tice. Currently, what exist are mostly descriptive literature reviews in the area of data  governance. In this paper, a systematic literature review (SLR), which offers a structured,  methodical, and rigorous approach to the understanding of the state of the art of research  in data governance. The objective of the study is to provide a credible intellectual guide  for upcoming researchers in data governance to help them identify areas in data govern- ance research where they can make the most impact. The systematic literature review  covered published contributions from both academia and industry. The presented SLR  searches and examines most relevant published work since year 2000 to-date for data  governance for non-cloud, and for cloud computing since 2007. Only 52 studies met the  inclusion criteria, which are critically reviewed. Keywords: Systematic Review, Data Governance, Cloud Computing, Cloud  Data Governance. Introduction   We are more accustomed to the concepts of IT governance[1] and corporate govern- ance [2]. The term ‘Governance’ in general refers to the way an organization goes about  ensuring that strategies are set, monitored, and achieved [3]. As IT has become a back- bone of every organization, by definition IT governance becomes an integral part of  any  business  strategies  and  falls  under  the  corporate  governance. Historically,  data  emerged out of disparate legacy transactional systems. Then,  data was seen as a by- This  continued until early 1990s, when the value of data started to take another trend beyond  transactions. Business decisions and processes started to be driven increasingly by data  and data analysis. Further investment in data management was the approach taken to  tackle the increasing volume, velocity and variety of data, such as complex data repos- itories, data warehouses, Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) and Customer Relation- ship Management(CRM)[4]. Data links became very complex and shared amongst mul- tiple systems, and the need for providing a single point of reference in order to simplify  daily functions became crucial, which gave birth to the master data management [5]. Data complexity and volume continue to explode; businesses have grown more so- phisticated in their use of data, which drives new demands that require different ways  to combine, manipulate, store, and present information; that forward thinking compa- nies recognized that data management solutions on their own are becoming very ex- pensive and not able to cope with business reality and they need to solve the data prob- lem in a different way[6]. During this time, the notion of data governance started to  take a different direction, a more important one. Attempts in governing data failed be- fore, as they were driven by Information Technology (IT), and affected by rigid pro- cesses and fragmented activities carried out on system by system basis. Up to very re- cently, governance is mostly informal, in siloes around specific enterprise repositories,  lacking structure and the wider support of the organization. Despite its recognized high  importance, data governance is still an under-researched area and less practiced in in- dustry[4], [7]. Researcher differ in defining data governance, the Data Governance In- stitute (DGI) defines it as follows “data governance is a system of decision rights and  accountabilities for information-related processes, executed according to agreed-upon  models which describe who can take what actions with what information, and when,  under what circumstances, using what methods”[8]. A recent development in technology is the emergence of cloud computing. The Na- tional  Institute of  Standards  and  Technology  (NIST)  defined  cloud  computing  as  “a  model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool  of  configurable  computing  resources  (e.g.,  networks,  servers,  storage,  applications,  and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management  effort or service provider interaction”[9]. Cloud computing model enhance availability  and  is  composed of five  essential  characteristics,  four  deployment models  and  three  service  models[10]. The  essential  characteristics  of  cloud  computing  include  on-de- mand self-service, broad network access, resource pooling, rapid elasticity and meas- ured service[11]. The cloud deployment models are  private, public, hybrid, and com- munity model[12], [13]. In addition, cloud computing include three service  delivery  models which are: Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) and In- frastructure as a Service (IaaS)[14]. Cloud computing offers potential benefits to public  and private organisations by making information technology (IT) services available as  a commodity[15], [16]. The general claimed benefits of cloud computing include: cost  efficiency,  unlimited  storage,  backup  and  recovery,  automatic  software  integration,  easy access to information, quick deployment, easier scale of services and delivery of  Furthermore, other benefits include: optimised server utilization, dy- namic scalability and minimised life cycle development of new applications. Though,  cloud computing is still not quite widely adopted because of many factors, but mostly  concerned with moving business data to be handled by third party[6] where in addition  to the cloud consumer and provider there are other actors; cloud auditor, cloud broker,  and cloud carrier [18]. Therefore, loss of control on data, security and privacy of data,  data  quality  and  assurance, data  stewardship  etc  can  all  be  cited  as  real  concerns  of  adopting the cloud computing business model[6]. Data lock-In is another potential risk,  whereupon cloud customers, who can face difficulties in extracting their data from the  cloud[19]. Cloud consumers can also suffer from operational and regulatory challenges,  as organisations transfer their data to third parties for storage and processing[6]. Also,  it may be difficult for the consumers to check the data handling practices of the cloud  provider or any of the other involved actors[15], [20], [21]. The cloud computing model  is expected to be a highly disruptive technology and the adoption of its services will,  therefore, require an even more rigorous data governance strategies and programmes,  which can be more complex, but necessary. The authors’ general observation reveals that the area of data governance in general  is under researched and not widely practiced by organisations, let alone when it is con- cerned with cloud computing, where research is really in its infancy and far from reach- ing maturity. This forms the main motivation behind this paper, which attempts to pro- vide the readers with a comprehensive review on data governance in both non-cloud  and cloud computing. The contribution of this paper is unprecedented, where a System- atic Literature Review (SLR) principles are followed meticulously, to ensure all quality  attributes of the review, including reliability, suitability, relevance and completeness. The mapping study also delivers the first systematic summary of cloud data governance  research. The categorization of available publications helps researchers gain an over- view of the state-of-the-art research and current research gaps for cloud data govern- ance. Regarding a systematic literature review approach, in the literature there are many  authors were using this approach to investigate the state of the art of the different sub- ject. The study in [22] was used a systematic literature review to investigate the state  of the art of the agile information systems development. The authors in [23] were used  this approach for evaluating, identifying and interpreting all available re- search rele- vant to state of the art of the requirements traceability. In addition, [24] conducted a  systematic review about the state of the art of the agile governance up to and including  2013, the study aims to understand better this context, our paper seeks to investigate  how the domain of agile governance has evolved, as well as to derive implications for  research and practice. The  next  section  describes  the  general  methodology  followed  for  conducting  this  review, followed by Section 3 which present the data governance important. Then, state  of the art of data governance present in Section 4, and Section 5 shows the the system- atic review results analysis. Section 6 and 7 presents analysis of state of the art of data  governance for non cloud and cloud computing, respectively. Finally, conclusion and  future work are present in section 8. Research Methodology  This  research  is  carried  as  a  systematic  literature  review  (SLR),  as  described  by  Kitchenham and Charter [25]. SLR is a mean of identifying, evaluating and interpreting  all available research relevant to a particular research question, topic or phenomenon  of  interest  [25]. The  main  reason  for  undertaking  SLR  is  to  summarize  the  existing  information about data governance by identifying the state of the art of data governance  in non-cloud and cloud environments, and to get a true reflection on current data gov- ernance research and practice, determining possible directions for researchers based on  the current literatures. The steps followed to successful conduct this systematic litera- ture review were deduced from the pioneering work of Kitchenham and Charter [25],  depicted  in  Fig.1.  The  objective  of  this  study  is  to  investigate  and  analyse  the  most  relevant published research that has been carried out on data governance, for non-cloud  and cloud computing. This study will attempt to address one main research question. RQ. What is the state of the art of research in data governance for non-cloud and  Cloud Computing? This combined question will allow for a comparison between research efforts in data  governance  for  non-cloud  and  for  cloud  computing. Though,  each  one  will  be  re- searched and analysed independently in order to build a good understanding of the state  of the art for data governance in cloud computing and non-cloud business models.

This context will clarify what data governance and hence help eliminate all irrelevant  literature, which might be confused with the concept of data governance. For instance,  often researchers and practitioners confuse between data governance and data manage- ment. The definition of data management provided by the Data Management Associa- tion (DAMA) is: “data management is the development, execution and supervision of  plans, policies, programs and practices that control, protect, deliver and enhance the  value of data and information assets”. Data management in general focuses on the de- fining of the data element, how it is stored, structured, and moved. DAMA defines data  governance as: “the exercise of authority, control and shared decision-making (plan- ning, monitoring and enforcement) over the management of data assets”. Data govern- ance is therefore, high-level planning and control over data management[26]. Authors  of [27] have also argued that data governance is different from data management; that  data governance complements data management, but does  not replace it. Authors of  [28] defined data governance as “a system of decision rights and accountabilities for  information-related processes, executed according to agreed-upon models which de- scribe who can take what actions with what information, and when, under what cir- cumstances,  using  what  methods”. While  authors  of  [6]  defined  data  governance  as  “specifies the framework for decision rights and accountabilities to encourage desira- ble behavior in the use of data. To promote desirable behavior, data governance devel- ops and implements corporate-wide data policies, guidelines, and standards that are  consistent with the organization’s mission, strategy, values, norms, and culture”. However, there is not an official definition about what is data governance. For an- swering this question, this study is going to refer some different definitions offered by  important organisations. The definitions above emphasize the significance of the ter- minals though which data governance activities can be executing on data related assets  which support the organisation's strategy. These definitions did not give equal prominence for the  data governance with cloud computing technology context. So, this requires to under- stand the data governance and cloud computing in depth. Some other researchers or practitioners may also confuse between Information Tech- nology Governance (IT governance) and data governance. IT governance is much more  mature area with the first publications on the topic released about four decades[29],  [30], while data governance is still under-researched. IT governance as “in- tegral  part  of  enterprise  governance  and  have  potential  to  provide  mechanisms  for  leadership and organisational structures and processes that ensure the organisation’s  IT  sustains  and  extends  the  organisation’s  strategies  and objectives”. Organizations  with mature IT governance practices tend to have stronger alignment between IT and  business[31]. Therefore, the different between data governance and IT governance is  data  governance  focus  on  govern  organisation  data  in  different  technology  environ- ment, while IT governance focus on govern IT equipment. In addition, [7] argues that  the organisations should get responsibility for data out of the IT department. Besides  of IT governance, data governance also has a significant role in aligning the organisa- tion's business[7]. Data governance can be used to solve assortment of business issues  related to data and information[6], [32], [33]. Authors of [29] also argued that a data  governance model helps organisations to structure and document the accountabilities  for their data quality. Authors of [34] have explicitly demonstrated that data governance  is different from IT governance in principal and practices. In principal, data governance  is  designed for  the governance  of  data  assets,  while  IT  governance  makes decisions  about IT investments, IT application portfolio, and the IT projects portfolio. In practice,  IT governance is designed primarily around an organization's hardware and applica- tions not its data. In addition, all  existing sources have hitherto only addressed data governance, partially[29]. The fact  that organisations need to take into account many aspects into consideration when im- plementing data governance has been neglected so far[36]. Moreover, some researchers  show  that  if  organisations  who  do  not  implement  an  effective  data  governance,  can  quickly loose any competitive advantage[28], [35]. Data governance requires the involvement and commitment of all staff with full  sponsorship by the management and senior-level executive sponsorship in any organi- zation[37], [38]. Recently, many organisations have become aware of the increasing importance of  governing their data, to ensure confidentiality, integrity, quality and availability of cus- tomers’ data[8], [39], [40]. There is no single approach to the implementation of data  governance program in all organizations[37]. A good data governance can help organ- isations to create a clear mission, achieve clarity, increase confidence of using the or- ganisational  data,  establish  accountabilities,  maintain  scope  and  focus,  and  define  measurable successes[4], [27]. Moreover, many authors suggested that developing an  effective data governance will lead to many benefits for organizations. These benefits  are: enabling better decision-making, reduce operational friction, and protect the needs  of data stakeholders as central to a governance program[32], [41]. In addition, other  benefits include: training of management and staff to adopt common approaches to data  issues,  build  standard,  repeatable  processes,  reduce  costs  and  increase  effectiveness  through coordination of efforts, and ensure transparency of processes[28], [32]. Due to  one size does not fit all, therefore, for any organization who wish to develop their data  governance strategy, they should be regarded as guidelines the barriers and CSFs which  are influence to implement their strategy before developing their strategy. State of the art of Data Governance  Based  on  applying  the  search  protocol  with  all  search  strings  and  study  selection  process that is described in Section 2, primary study is selected.

To best of the authors this study considers the first study which covers  the cloud data governance, all sources in the literature just covers some relevant in data  governance in general and in cloud computing. The studies were categorized into the  following main groups:  State of the art of data governance for non-cloud computing. State of the art of data governance for cloud computing. Based  on  the  main  categorized  that  mentioned  above  the  results  will  be  describe  These results are briefly explained in the following:  Publications Year   Table 4 shows the number of articles published on data governance for non-cloud in  each year during 2000-2017. Out of 52 records, the total studies on data governance for  non-cloud computing was 41 records (78.85%).

The  study  then  surveys  the  data  governance  state  of  practice  of  four  platform  ecosystems:  Facebook, YouTube, EBay and Uber. Data governance has been an emerging trend in enterprise information management  [85]. In the literature, a limited number of studies which have discussed the important  area of data governance. The roots of data governance research can be traced back to  early 1980s, however, the first efforts to propose a framework for data governance were  published in 2007 [6]. Data Quality Management (DQM) and or- ganizational structuring. The work published by authors of [68] was the only  attempt in literature to review the area of  data governance, up until 2010. This work  aimed at developing morphology of data governance organisation. Six mini case studies  were used in this study to assess the morphology of the organisation of data governance. Other researcher such as [86] they suggested to transfer knowledge build in IT govern- ance into the development of data governance program. However, [67] argued that or- ganisations should establish a data governance structure to get responsibility for data  out of the IT department. According to [43], similar to IT governance, data governance  also  needs  to  align  with  any  organisation’s  business  strategy. Other authors have also related data governance to accountability  such  as  [7],  [67];  also  [88]  stated  that  organisations  must  design  a  data  governance  model of roles responsibilities to identify people who have a level of accountability to  Authors of [7] has also outlined a  data governance model, which comprised of three components; data quality roles, de- cision areas and responsibilities. Data governance requires the participation and com- mitment of all IT staff, management and senior-level executive [89]. They  argued that an effective data governance framework can help organisations to create a  clear mission, achieve clarity, increase confidence of using the organisational data, es- tablish accountabilities, maintain scope and focus, and define measurable success cri- teria. In support of Fu et al argument, other authors added that a good data governance  framework supports compliance and legal efforts over the long term by organizing data  for retrieval and retention as well as building better relationships with customers and  partners, which enhance income opportunities [28], [68], [90]. Enterprise Data Warehouse, in order to achieve an effective data  governance framework, which should be based on structure, process and communica- tion. Section 5.1 presents different data governance frameworks, emerging from this  systematic literature review. Despite the repeated call by researchers for the need of  data governance frameworks, our study shows only a handful of them, mainly devel- oped by industry associations such as DAMA, DGI and IBM IBM [6], [43], [57], [76],   In 2011 [68] proposed a framework for data governance, which consists of goals and  structure. The goals are divided into formal IT, business and functional goals, while the  structure is divided into focus of control, organizational form, and roles & committees. According to DGI, the development of data governance framework is a complex task  that could be formed of various related items that include programs, stages, decision  domain, universal objects, and components. DGI divides their framework (see Fig.5)  activity into three components, namely the rules & roles, people and organizations [43],  [91]. In addition, IBM's approach to data governance was built from the perspective of  the vendor data governance software provider, so establishing a data governance will  require software support [43], [92]. This Model shows that the organizations need to  ensure that the business and IT problems must be clearly defined, with full executive   [43]. The IBM model include fourteen elements, ten of them are required and four are  optional (see Fig.6) [43], [92], [93]. Fig. DGI Framework of Data Governance[91]. Fig. IBM Data Governance Unified Process[93]. In 2010 [4] focused more on defining critical success factors for an effective data  governance, which he categorized into organizational and technological  success fac- tors. The organizational factors  include  clear  definition of roles  and  responsibilities,  business and IT involvement, executive sponsorship and Integration competency cen- ter. The technological factors include the automation of data integration life cycle to  deliver on the goals of data  governance. Successful data governance, therefore,  requires bringing together a diverse expertise from various departments into any one  organisation  to  achieve  consistency,  transparency  and  repeatability  of processes  that  enable best data-related decision making  [95]and establish accountabilities, maintain  scope and focus, and define measurable successes [4]  and support compliance and legal  efforts over the long term by organising data for retrieval and retention[32], and im- prove income opportunities and customer and partner relationships[31]. Table 9 sum- marises all critical success factors for implementing effective data governance frame- works and programmes, as reported in literature for non- cloud computing as a result  of the aforementioned systematic literature review.

Analysis of the state of the art for data governance for cloud  computing   Data governance for cloud computing    To recall, one of the main reasons that impedes the wider adoption of the cloud com- puting model have been linked primarily to aspects related to data governance[40], [60]. While security shows to be the most cited challenge to cloud adoption,[98] show that  41% of the security problems in the cloud are related to governance and legal issues. Cloud governance is a new term in the IT field, and it is still under-developed [99],  [100]. Microsoft defines cloud governance as “defining policies around managing the  factors: availability, security, privacy, location of cloud services and compliance and  tracking for enforcing the policies at run time when the applications are running”. Data  governance  is  considered  as one  of  the most  important  aspects  in  cloud  governance  [40], [100]. Data governance program, built for on-premises IT infrastructure, cannot  be deployed for a cloud infrastructure and service provisioning, which would require a  completely  new  requirements,  design  and  implementation  [101],  [102],[103],[100]. Undoubtedly, the area of cloud data governance is becoming a topic of the next coming  decades [32], although, it is still under researched by both academia and industry due  to its novelty [4], [86]. As discussed in Section 5, data governance is still under devel- oped  and  under  practiced  even  for  traditional  IT  infrastructures,  let  alone  for  cloud  computing environments. This section presents further analysis to the state of the art of  data governance for cloud computing. The analysis is based on the results of  the pre- sented systematic review conducted for this purpose, which has identified only 11 rec- ords  discussing  data  governance  for  cloud  computing. Table  10  shows  the  main  re- search contributions on data governance for cloud computing. Table 10. Academic research on data governance for cloud computing. Study Name  Is data governance in  cloud  computing  still  a  mirage or do we have a  vision we can trust? Accountability  for  data  governance  in  Cloud  ecosystems. Interoperability analysis  of accountable data gov- ernance in the Cloud  Authors  [48]  Main Conclusion  Provides a brief about data governance and issues  in cloud computing. It also provides a list of some con- cerns related with data management and data protec- tion in cloud computing. The paper focuses mainly on the accountability as- pect  in  cloud  data  governance. In  this  paper  the  au- thors proposed model that allows to explain cloud data  governance, in terms of accountability attributes and  cloud-mediated interactions between actors. This  paper  presented  an  accountability  based  ap- proach for cloud data governance, as a mean for ad- dressing interoperability requirements relating to the  protection of personal and confidential data involved  in complex service provision chains in the cloud. Study Name  Architectural  Require- ments  for  Cloud  Com- puting Systems: An En- terprise Cloud  Towards  User  Cen- tric Data  Governance  and Control in the Cloud   Authors  [105]  Main Conclusion  This paper emphasized the importance of data gov- ernance  for  any  enterprise  cloud,  especially  when  dealing with sensitive data. This paper  advocates the users’ role in managing  Governance in the cloud needs understanding, moderating and regulating the  rela- tionships between different cloud actors or stakeholders in terms of roles and responsi- bilities [12]. Data governance is meant to classify and assign responsibilities, commu- nication, labelling, and policies [100]. There are little studies reported on data govern- ance  for  the  cloud  services. Almost  all  existing  work  on  data  governance  for  cloud  computing focus on accountability and Interoperability [11],  [13]. The research pre- sented in [47] proposed a model that explains data governance in terms of accountabil- ity attributes and cloud-mediated interactions between actors. According to authors of  [47] and alike, it is accountability that identifies the relationships between cloud actors  in  terms  of  data  governance;  it  also  enhances  trust  between  cloud  actors  [47],[106]. Accountability could be addressed at different levels, technological, regulatory and or- ganizational [107]. Authors of [47] define accountability as:”accountability consists of  defining governance to comply in a responsible manner with internal and external cri- teria, ensuring implementation of appropriate actions, explaining and justifying those  actions  and  remedying  any  failure  to  act  properly”. As  result,  accountability  is  one  aspect of cloud data  governance, therefore that is not quite  enough to achieve cloud  data governance goals. The cloud data governance needs more offers from academic  researcher to design data governance strategy or program to cover all aspects of cloud  data governance. Cloud data governance has also been overlooked by industry. According to authors  in [60],[108],[63],[39], Cloud Security Alliance, Trustworthy Computing Group, and  Microsoft corporation are regarded as the recognized leaders in this area. The Cloud  Security Alliance cloud data governance working group currently focuses on the data  protection aspect, with an aim to propose a data governance framework for ensuring  the availability, integrity, privacy and overall security of data in different cloud models;  this is far from being realized [108]. Trustworthy Computing Group and Microsoft cor- poration describe the basic elements of a data governance initiative for privacy, confi- dentiality, and compliance, and provide guides to help organisations get started down  this path [63]. According to MeriTalk report in 2014, only 44% of IT professionals in  the federal government believe their agencies have mature data governance practices in  the cloud. This report also suggests that there are about 56% of agencies currently in  the process of implementing data stewardship or data governance programs [109]. As  results, also the work that provide by industry regarding cloud data governance is quite  enough to achieve cloud data governance goals, and to provide good solutions to deci- Critical challenges to implement data governance in cloud   The adoption of new technology such as cloud computing in organisations require a  good data governance strategy for the adoption to be successful  [4]. There are many  challenging issues  which  could  affect the  implementation  of data  governance in  the  cloud, these can be classified as technological, legal, and business, and are discussed  below. Technological Challenges   Security is one of the major concerns for organisations who seek to adopt cloud  computing[110], with some managers reporting that their sensitive data will never  be in the cloud [111]. There are several specific areas such as hardware and soft- ware, which require important security attention in the cloud environments. Issues  to consider in security include, the security of data at rest and motion, the security  of cloud data storage, and Incident response[112]. Privacy and data protection considerations are concerns for organisations inter- ested in implementing data governance in the cloud. This is because an organiza- tion  using  cloud  may  not  have  full  control  of  their  data  stored  on  cloud-based  servers [113]. Cloud providers also don’t guarantee better confidentiality of cus- tomers data [114]. Therefore, the aspect of security and confidentiality must in- terface to protect the data in enterprises. Availability has become a concern to adopting the cloud and implementing data  governance in organisations  [115]. A number of factors exist which negatively  impact on availability in the cloud, these include security, protecting the confi- dentiality and integrity of data, and Identifying single points of failure [115]. Performance is one of the concerns for organisations when moving their service  and data to the cloud. It includes more extensive concepts such as reliability, en- ergy efficiency, and scalability  [116], [117]. There are many factors which can  influence the performance of the cloud, such as security, recovery, service level  agreements, network bandwidth, storage capacity, availability, number of users  and data location [117]. Data classification in the cloud is another challenge for cloud consumers and pro- viders. This challenge emanates from the lack of classification of data based on  sensitivity. The protection of sensitive data is important for any organisation when  moving data to the cloud. Classification of data facilitates the implementation of  appropriate security controls such as role-based access, among many others. This  has also been a major area of concern for consumers of cloud services, because  they are not aware who is accessing their data. As a result, assuring cloud service  consumers that their data is not being accessed by unauthorized parties has been  a major challenge to cloud service providers [118]. Data migration is another significant concern in cloud computing which is related   to data governance [119], [120]. There are a number of considerations that should  be made when migrating data between different cloud systems. These considera- tions include scalability, availability, load balancing, cost-efficiency and availa- bility  [121]. Load balancing ensures that servers are  not overwhelmed by data. Requests are distributed between multiple servers, which ensures very quick op- erations on the data stored on the cloud [36]. Legal Challenges  Legal  contracts  written  between  cloud  actors  are  expressed  in  very  complicated  statements. Hence, customers find it very difficult to understand legal and regulatory  implications of such agreements [122]. The legal framework for cloud computing still  remains at an unsatisfactory level in many countries [123]. For example, Middle East- ern countries and Africa lack compulsory regulatory support for data protection, gov- ernance, and privacy [122], [124]. There are many legal factors which affect an organ- ization when implementing data governance in the cloud. These  include compliance  with regulations, and physical location [102]. In addition, statutory, regulatory, and le- gal requirements differ by market sector and jurisdiction, and they can change the re- sponsibilities of both cloud consumers and cloud providers. Organisational/Business Challenges   Cloud computing supports organisations in embracing new business opportunities to  improve their current business performance, respond to crisis  situations, and change  their current business model [34], [102]. In addition, data governance strategy is essen- tial for supporting business functions in any organisations [4]. There are many organi- zational factors that affect an organisation’s implementation of data governance pro- grams  in  the  cloud. These    include  top  management  support,  organization  size,  and  technology readiness [102], [126]. Additionally, currently there is no single approach  to the implementation of data governance in all organisations. Literature review identi- fies a significant gap in the lack of appropriate and effective data governance in the  cloud. Organisations need to embrace data governance program in the cloud, no matter  where data is created, used and stored. Nonetheless, technological, legal, and organiza- tional  challenges  are  among  the  many  challenges  that  impact  on  implementing  data  governance in the cloud. Key Dimensions for Cloud Data Governance  Many researchers have recognized a need to implement data governance for cloud  computing[47],[105],[40],[48]. To  implement  data  governance  for  cloud  computing,  services must determine the data governance key dimension. Identifying the specific  data  governance  dimensions  for  the  cloud  services  is  potentially  a  complex  process,  consequently, it needs more investigative efforts involving different stakeholders. Thus,  the study presented here is based merrily on analyzing the relevant knowledge in the  public domain, following the Analytic Theory[127]. In this study the Analytic Theory  IT  and  the  cloud technology. The authors in [68] urge that the use of the analytic theory to describe  or classify specific dimensions or characteristics of individuals, groups,  situations, or  events,  by  summarizing  the  commonalities  found  in  discrete  observations”. Frame- works, classification schema, and taxonomies are numerous in IS. The analytic theory  has been chosen as a concept for this study to identify data governance dimensions for  the cloud services. To use analytic theory for making data governance dimensions, we  follow a number of steps. Foremost, to understand the state-of-the art of data governance  for traditional IT, and the cloud. In addition, to identify specific dimensions or charac- teristics of data governance and cloud computing. Finally, to develop the key data gov- ernance dimensions for cloud computing based on the definitions of data governance  and its factors that present in the literature review. To the best of our knowledge, and  following the aforementioned systematic review of literature, there is no published re- search that defines key dimensions of data governance for cloud computing. In contrast,  for traditional IT (non-cloud), although few, there is some reported research. As illus- trated above, data governance for non-cloud and cloud, albeit with some similarities at  a higher level, differ significantly in the details, in addition to some new factors related  only to the cloud technology mentioned. Therefore, it is useful to discuss these similar- ities and differences. Data governance for traditional IT (non-cloud) could be built upon  six dimensions, which are described below:   Data governance function,   2. Data governance structure,   3. Organisational,   4. Technical,   5. Environmental   6. Measuring& monitoring tool. The cloud paradigm however, introduces new factors, which needs to be taken into  consideration when designing and implementing any cloud data governance program. These new factors are described below. By considering these new factors, the key di- mensions for implementing data governance for cloud computing are depicted in Fig.7.  •  Cloud deployment model: it is the important factor that consider in the data  governance. There are primarily four cloud deployment models that differ in  risk and concern about control and security, and contractual barriers. That are  public, private, hybrid and community. To address data governance, the level  of risk and complexity of each cloud deployment must be taken into consider- ation[9]. Service delivery model: cloud services can be categorized into three delivery  models; Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and  In- frastructure as a Service (IaaS)[128]. Depending on the model, the cloud con- sumer loses control on their data, since the cloud provider has responsibility  to manage some components in these model[40]. Therefore, the data govern- ance teams have to consider all characteristics of the service delivery model,  Cloud Actors: are also a critical factor into data governance for the cloud ser- vices. Cloud actors refers to a person or an organization that participates in  processes or a transaction, and/or performs tasks in cloud computing environ- ment. NISTs cloud computing reference architecture distinguishes five major  actors; the cloud consumer, the cloud provider, the cloud auditor, the cloud  carrier, and the cloud broker [9]. All of the aforementioned have special roles  and responsibilities in the cloud, so the data governance teams must clearly  define the roles and responsibilities for all cloud actors. Service Level Agreement (SLA): One key issue for the cloud consumer is the  provision  of  governance  for  data  which  it  no  longer  directly  controls[129]. Contractual barriers increase between cloud actors. A SLA is an agreement  that serves as the foundation of expectation for service(s) between the cloud  consumer and the provider. The agreement states what services will be pro- vided, how they will be provided, and what happens if the expectations are not  met. Therefore, SLA is pivotal in data governance. Thus, the cloud consumer  and provider have to negotiate all aspects of data governance before develop- ing the SLA. As a result, these agreements are in place to protect both parties. Fig. Key dimensions for cloud data governance. Data governance function: This refers to master activities for data governance,  including functions which data governance teams have to take in account when  The outcomes from data gov- ernance  function  activities  include  policies,  principles,  processes,  decision  rights,  roles  and  responsibilities,  communication  plans  and  change  manage- ment. This is considered the master dimension for data governance, nonethe- less, it must comply with other dimensions to develop an effective data gov- ernance. Data  governance  structure:  Designing  data  governance  structure  is  an  im- portant factor in ensuring that requisite roles and responsibilities are addressed  throughout the enterprise at the right organizational levels [28]. Several com- mon data governance roles have been identified in existing studies, including  the  following:  executive  sponsor,  data  governance  council,  data  governance  office, chief Steward, business and technical data Steward [7],[31]. These roles  have to collaborate to formulate data governance bodies. Organisational: Organisational factors are important for data governance to be  successful [30]. Data governance requires change management in the organi- zation, in addition to the participation and commitment of IT staff, business  management,  and  senior-level  executive  sponsorship  in  organizations  [31]. Moreover, top management support is considered as the critical success factor  for  implementing  data  governance  [28]. Staff  in  organizations  need  to  learn  data governance functions, demanding top management support to enhance an  organization staffs’ skillset. Technical: Technology is also a key element for data governance success [37]. Therefore,  lack  of  technology  considers  common  barriers  to  successful  data  governance. Technical factors encapsulate data management issues that affect  organisations’  strategies  such  as  security,  privacy,  quality  and  integrity. As  such, it is incumbent upon organisations which anticipate to implement data  governance, to assess all technological characteristics available at the organi- sations, to effectively implement data governance. Environmental: Environmental factors refers to external environmental consid- erations such as government legislation, and data protection act[102]. The data  governance teams have to consider all environmental aspects when designing  data governance functions. This means that data governance functions have to  comply with the environments. This consideration immensely contributes  to- wards building strong data governance in the organisation. Measuring & Monitoring Tool: Measuring and monitoring supports ongoing  data  governance  efforts  to  ensure  that  all  incoming  and  existing  data  meets  business  rules  [38]. By  adding  a  monitoring  component  to  data  governance  program, data quality efforts are enhanced, which in turn renders data much  more reliable [26]. As mentioned above, the above six dimensions are common  when implementing data governance for cloud or traditional IT, however, they  Table 11 is an attempt to show some of these  differences.
