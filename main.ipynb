       "     ('abstract', 'Information technology has dramatically increased online business opportunities; however these opportunities have also created serious risks in relation to information security. Previously, information security issues were studied in a technological context, but growing security needs have extended researchers’ attention to explore the management role in information security management. Various studies have explored different management roles and activities, but none has given a comprehensive picture of these roles and activities to manage information security effectively. So it is necessary to accumulate knowledge about various managerial roles and activities from literature to enable managers to adopt these for a more holistic approach to information security management. In this paper, using a systematic literature review approach, we synthesised literature related to management’s roles in information security to explore speciﬁc managerial activities to enhance information security management. We found that numerous activities of management, particularly development and execution of information security policy, awareness, compliance training, development of effective enterprise information architecture, IT infrastructure management, business and IT alignment and human resources management, had a significant impact on the quality of management of information security. Thus, this research makes a novel contribution by arguing that a more holistic approach to information security is needed and we suggest the ways in which managers can play an effective role in information security. This research also opens up many new avenues for further research in this area.'), \n",

       "     ('abstract', 'The rise of Big, Open and Linked Data (BOLD) enables Big Data Algorithmic Systems (BDAS) which are often based on machine learning, neural networks and other forms of Artificial Intelligence (AI). As such systems are increasingly requested to make decisions that are consequential to individuals, communities and society at large, their failures cannot be tolerated, and they are subject to stringent regulatory and ethical requirements. However, they all rely on data which is not only big, open and linked but varied, dynamic and streamed at high speeds in real-time. Managing such data is challenging. To overcome such challenges and utilize opportunities for BDAS, organizations are increasingly developing advanced data governance capabilities. This paper reviews challenges and approaches to data governance for such systems, and proposes a framework for data governance for trustworthy BDAS. The framework promotes the stewardship of data, processes and algorithms, the controlled opening of data and algorithms to enable external scrutiny, trusted information sharing within and between organizations, risk-based governance, system-level controls, and data control through shared ownership and self-sovereign identities. The framework is based on 13 design principles and is proposed incrementally, for a single organization and multiple networked organizations.'), \n",

       "     ('abstract', 'Introduction Organizations are becoming increasingly serious about the notion of \"data as an asset\" as they face increasing pressure for reporting a \"single version of the truth.\" In a 2006 survey of 359 North American organizations that had deployed business intelligence and analytic systems, a program for the governance of data was reported to be one of the five success \"practices\" for deriving business value from data assets. In light of the opportunities to leverage data assets as well ensure legislative compliance to mandates such as the Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) Act and Basel II, data governance has also recently been given significant prominence in practitioners\\' conferences, such as TDWI (The Data Warehousing Institute) World Conference and DAMA (Data Management Association) International Symposium. The objective of this article is to provide an overall framework for data governance that can be used by researchers to focus on important data governance issues, and by practitioners to develop an effective data governance approach, strategy and design. Designing data governance requires stepping back from day-to-day decision making and focusing on identifying the fundamental decisions that need to be made and who should be making them. Based on Weill and Ross, we also differentiate between governance and management as follows: • Governance refers to what decisions must be made to ensure effective management and use of IT ( decision domains ) and who makes the decisions ( locus of accountability for decision-making ). • Management involves making and implementing decisions. For example, governance includes establishing who in the organization holds decision rights for determining standards for data quality. Management involves determining the actual metrics employed for data quality. Here, we focus on the former. Corporate governance has been defined as a set of relationships between a company\\'s management, its board, its shareholders and other stakeholders that provide a structure for determining organizational objectives and monitoring performance, thereby ensuring that corporate objectives are attained. Considering the synergy between macroeconomic and structural policies, corporate governance is a key element in not only improving economic efficiency and growth, but also enhancing corporate confidence. A framework for linking corporate and IT governance (see Figure 1) has been proposed by Weill and Ross. Unlike these authors, however, we differentiate between IT assets and information assets: IT assets refers to technologies (computers, communication and databases) that help support the automation of well-defined tasks, while information assets (or data) are defined as facts having value or potential value that are documented. Note that in the context of this article, we do not differentiate between data and information. Next, we use the Weill and Ross framework for IT governance as a starting point for our own framework for data governance. We then propose a set of five data decision domains, why they are important, and guidelines for what governance is needed for each decision domain. By operationalizing the locus of accountability of decision making (the \"who\") for each decision domain, we create a data governance matrix, which can be used by practitioners to design their data governance.

Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) compliance requires accurate financial data and to achieve this IT controls are designed to ensure that data is correct and protected from unauthorised change. Data quality is measured by its accuracy, timeliness, relevance, completeness, trustworthiness and contextual definition. Good data quality requires effective data management. The research looks at the need for Data Governance to manage data effectively. This study examines a large organisation that has adopted an ad-hoc Data Governance model to manage its data. It was found that its data management efforts were hampered mainly by the lack of clear roles and responsibilities and the lack of mandate to carry out data quality improvement initiatives. In order to promote effective data management, this research identifies a Data Governance Structure and Framework with the emphasis on collaboration between business and IT to support organisations.'), \n",

Applying data governance to research data management processes and data literacy education helps in delineating decision domains and defining accountability for decision making. Adopting data governance is advantageous, because it is a service based on standardised, repeatable processes and is designed to enable the transparency of data-related processes and cost reduction. It is also useful, because it refers to rules, policies, standards; decision rights; accountabilities and methods of enforcement. Therefore, although it received more attention in corporate settings and some of the skills related to it are already possessed by librarians, knowledge on data governance is foundational for research data services, especially as it appears on all levels of research data services, and is applicable to big data.'), \n",

Both sides agree that data governance primarily is a matter of organisation. However, hardly any scientific results have been produced so far indicating what actually has to be organised by data governance, and what data governance may look like. The paper aims at closing this gap by developing a morphology of data governance organisation on the basis of a comprehensive analysis of the state of the art both in science and in practice. Epistemologically, the morphology represents an analytic theory, as it serves for structuring the research topic of data governance, which is still quite unexplored. Six mini case studies are used to evaluate the morphology by means of empirical data. Providing a foundation for further research, the morphology contributes to the advancement of the scientific body of knowledge.

With data governance, however, companies implement corporatewide accountabilities for DQM that encompass professionals from business and IT. This paper outlines a data governance model comprised of three components. Data quality roles, decision areas and responsibilities build a matrix, comparable to a RACI chart.

While major attention is currently given to the dominant model of corporate platforms collecting and economically exploiting massive amounts of personal data, other actors, such as small businesses, public bodies and civic society, take also part in data governance. The article sheds light on four models emerging from the practices of these actors: data sharing pools, data cooperatives, public data trusts and personal data sovereignty. We propose a social science-informed conceptualisation of data governance. Drawing from the notion of data infrastructure we identify the models as a function of the stakeholders’ roles, their interrelationships, articulations of value, and governance principles. Addressing the politics of data, we considered the actors’ competitive struggles for governing data. This conceptualisation brings to the forefront the power relations and multifaceted economic and social interactions within data governance models emerging in an environment mainly dominated by corporate actors. These models highlight that civic society and public bodies are key actors for democratising data governance and redistributing value produced through data. Through the discussion of the models, their underpinning principles and limitations, the article wishes to inform future investigations of sociotechnical imaginaries for the governance of data, particularly now that the policy debate around data governance is very active in Europe.'), \n",

Asset management organizations are by nature data intensive to manage their assets like bridges, dykes, railways and roads. For this, they often implement data lakes using a variety of architectures and technologies to store big data and facilitate data science initiatives. However, the decision-outcomes of data science models are often highly reliant on the quality of the data. The data in the data lake therefore has to be of sufficient quality to develop trust by decision-makers. Not surprisingly, organizations are increasingly adopting data governance as a means to ensure that the quality of data entering the data lake is and remains of sufficient quality, and to ensure the organization remains legally compliant. The objective of the case study is to understand the role of data governance as success factor for data science. For this, a case study regarding the governance of data in a data lake in the asset management domain is analyzed to test three propositions contributing to the success of using data science. The results show that unambiguous ownership of the data, monitoring the quality of the data entering the data lake, and a controlled overview of standard and specific compliance requirements are important factors for maintaining data quality and compliance and building trust in data science products.'), \n",

Hitherto, companies have assigned accountabilities for DQM mostly to IT departments. They have thereby ignored the organizationalissues that are critical to the success of DQM. With data governance, however, companies implement corporate-wide accountabilities for DQM that encompass professionals from business and IT. This paper outlines a data governance model comprised of three components that build a matrix comparable to an RACI chart: data quality roles, decision areas, and responsibilities. The data governance model documents the data quality roles and their type of interaction with DQM activities. In addition, the paper identifies contingency factors that impact the model configuration. Companies can structure their company-specific data governance model based on these findings.'), \n",

The transformative features of contemporary data science derive not only from the availability of Big Data and powerful computing, but also from a fundamental shift in the conceptualization of data as research materials and sources of evidence. A relational view of data is proposed, within which the meaning assigned to data depends on the motivations and instruments used to analyze them and to defend specific interpretations. The presentation of data, the way they are identified, selected and included (or excluded) in databases and the information provided to users to re-contextualize them are fundamental to producing knowledge - and significantly influence its content.

Nowadays organizations can store huge amounts of data, which can be accessible at any time. Big Data governance refers to the management of huge volumes of an organization’s data, exploiting it in the organization’s decision-making using different analytical tools. Big Data emergence provides great convenience, but it also brings challenges. Nevertheless, for Big Data governance, data has to be prepared in a timely manner, keeping in view the consistency and reliability of the data, and being able to trust its source and the meaningfulness of the result. Hence, a framework for Big Data governance would have many advantages. There are Big Data governance frameworks, which guide the management of Big Data. However, there are also limitations associated with these frameworks. Therefore, this study aims to explore the existing Big Data governance frameworks and their shortcomings, and propose a new framework. The proposed framework consists of eight components.

Discussion: We describe uses of NLP/TM techniques to support increased automation of systematic literature reviews. This area has attracted increase attention in the last decade due to significant gaps in the applicability of TM to automate steps in the SLR process. There are significant gaps in the application of TM and related automation techniques in the areas of data extraction, monitoring, quality assessment and data synthesis.

       "     y year, phishing results in losses of billions of dollars and is a major threat to the Internet economy. Phishing attacks are now most often carried out by email. To better comprehend the existing research trend of phishing email detection, several review studies have been performed. However, it is important to assess this issue from different perspectives. None of the surveys have ever comprehensively studied the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for detection of phishing except one that shed light on the use of NLP techniques for classiﬁcation and training purposes, while exploring a few alternatives. To bridge the gap, this study aims to systematically review and synthesise research on the use of NLP for detecting phishing emails. Based on speciﬁc predeﬁned criteria, a total of 100 research articles published between 2006 and 2022 were identiﬁed and analysed. We study the key research areas in phishing email detection using NLP, machine learning algorithms used in phishing detection email, text features in phishing emails, datasets and resources that have been used in phishing emails, and the evaluation criteria. The ﬁndings include that the main research area in phishing detection studies is feature extraction and selection, followed by methods for classifying and optimizing the detection of phishing emails. Amongst the range of classiﬁcation algorithms, support vector machines (SVMs) are heavily utilised for detecting phishing emails. The most frequently used NLP techniques are found to be TF-IDF and word embeddings. Furthermore, the most commonly used datasets for benchmarking phishing email detection methods is the Nazario phishing corpus. Also, Python is the most commonly used one for phishing email detection. It is expected that the ﬁndings of this paper can be helpful for the scientiﬁc community, especially in the ﬁeld of NLP application in cybersecurity problems. This survey also is unique in the sense that it relates works to their openly available tools and resources. The analysis of the presented works revealed that not much work had been performed on Arabi\n",

      "'We are more accustomed to the concepts of IT governance[1] and corporate govern- ance [2].'\n",
      "'The term ‘Governance’ in general refers to the way an organization goes about  ensuring that strategies are set, monitored, and achieved [3].'\n",
      "'As IT has become a back- bone of every organization, by definition IT governance becomes an integral part of  any  business  strategies  and  falls  under  the  corporate  governance.'\n",
      "' Historically,  data  emerged out of disparate legacy transactional systems.'\n",
      "'Then,  data was seen as a by-'\n",
      "'product of running the business and had little value beyond the transaction and the ap- plication that processed it, hence data was not treated as a valuable shared asset.'\n",
      "'This  continued until early 1990s, when the value of data started to take another trend beyond  transactions.'\n",
      "'Business decisions and processes started to be driven increasingly by data  and data analysis.'\n",
      "'Further investment in data management was the approach taken to  tackle the increasing volume, velocity and variety of data, such as complex data repos- itories, data warehouses, Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) and Customer Relation- ship Management(CRM)[4].'\n",
      "'Data links became very complex and shared amongst mul- tiple systems, and the need for providing a single point of reference in order to simplify  daily functions became crucial, which gave birth to the master data management [5].'\n",
      "'Data complexity and volume continue to explode; businesses have grown more so- phisticated in their use of data, which drives new demands that require different ways  to combine, manipulate, store, and present information; that forward thinking compa- nies recognized that data management solutions on their own are becoming very ex- pensive and not able to cope with business reality and they need to solve the data prob- lem in a different way[6].'\n",
      "'During this time, the notion of data governance started to  take a different direction, a more important one.'\n",
      "'Attempts in governing data failed be- fore, as they were driven by Information Technology (IT), and affected by rigid pro- cesses and fragmented activities carried out on system by system basis.'\n",
      "'Up to very re- cently, governance is mostly informal, in siloes around specific enterprise repositories,  lacking structure and the wider support of the organization.'\n",
      "'Despite its recognized high  importance, data governance is still an under-researched area and less practiced in in- dustry[4], [7].'\n",
      "'Researcher differ in defining data governance, the Data Governance In- stitute (DGI) defines it as follows “data governance is a system of decision rights and  accountabilities for information-related processes, executed according to agreed-upon  models which describe who can take what actions with what information, and when,  under what circumstances, using what methods”[8].'\n",
      "'A recent development in technology is the emergence of cloud computing.'\n",
      "'The Na- tional  Institute of  Standards  and  Technology  (NIST)  defined  cloud  computing  as  “a  model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool  of  configurable  computing  resources  (e.g.,  networks,  servers,  storage,  applications,  and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management  effort or service provider interaction”[9].'\n",
      "'Cloud computing model enhance availability  and  is  composed of five  essential  characteristics,  four  deployment models  and  three  service  models[10].'\n",
      "' The  essential  characteristics  of  cloud  computing  include  on-de- mand self-service, broad network access, resource pooling, rapid elasticity and meas- ured service[11].'\n",
      "'The cloud deployment models are  private, public, hybrid, and com- munity model[12], [13].'\n",
      "'In addition, cloud computing include three service  delivery  models which are: Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) and In- frastructure as a Service (IaaS)[14].'\n",
      "'Cloud computing offers potential benefits to public  and private organisations by making information technology (IT) services available as  a commodity[15], [16].'\n",
      "'The general claimed benefits of cloud computing include: cost  efficiency,  unlimited  storage,  backup  and  recovery,  automatic  software  integration,  easy access to information, quick deployment, easier scale of services and delivery of '\n",
      "'new services[17].'\n",
      "'Furthermore, other benefits include: optimised server utilization, dy- namic scalability and minimised life cycle development of new applications.'\n",
      "'Though,  cloud computing is still not quite widely adopted because of many factors, but mostly  concerned with moving business data to be handled by third party[6] where in addition  to the cloud consumer and provider there are other actors; cloud auditor, cloud broker,  and cloud carrier [18].'\n",
      "'Therefore, loss of control on data, security and privacy of data,  data  quality  and  assurance, data  stewardship  etc  can  all  be  cited  as  real  concerns  of  adopting the cloud computing business model[6].'\n",
      "'Data lock-In is another potential risk,  whereupon cloud customers, who can face difficulties in extracting their data from the  cloud[19].'\n",
      "'Cloud consumers can also suffer from operational and regulatory challenges,  as organisations transfer their data to third parties for storage and processing[6].'\n",
      "'Also,  it may be difficult for the consumers to check the data handling practices of the cloud  provider or any of the other involved actors[15], [20], [21].'\n",
      "'The cloud computing model  is expected to be a highly disruptive technology and the adoption of its services will,  therefore, require an even more rigorous data governance strategies and programmes,  which can be more complex, but necessary.'\n",
      "'The authors’ general observation reveals that the area of data governance in general  is under researched and not widely practiced by organisations, let alone when it is con- cerned with cloud computing, where research is really in its infancy and far from reach- ing maturity.'\n",
      "'This forms the main motivation behind this paper, which attempts to pro- vide the readers with a comprehensive review on data governance in both non-cloud  and cloud computing.'\n",
      "'The contribution of this paper is unprecedented, where a System- atic Literature Review (SLR) principles are followed meticulously, to ensure all quality  attributes of the review, including reliability, suitability, relevance and completeness.'\n",
      "' The mapping study also delivers the first systematic summary of cloud data governance  research.'\n",
      "'The categorization of available publications helps researchers gain an over- view of the state-of-the-art research and current research gaps for cloud data govern- ance.'\n",
      "'Regarding a systematic literature review approach, in the literature there are many  authors were using this approach to investigate the state of the art of the different sub- ject.'\n",

      "'Authors  of [27] have also argued that data governance is different from data management; that  data governance complements data management, but does  not replace it.'\n",
      "' Authors of  [28] defined data governance as “a system of decision rights and accountabilities for  information-related processes, executed according to agreed-upon models which de- scribe who can take what actions with what information, and when, under what cir- cumstances,  using  what  methods”.'\n",
      "' While  authors  of  [6]  defined  data  governance  as  “specifies the framework for decision rights and accountabilities to encourage desira- ble behavior in the use of data.'\n",
      "'To promote desirable behavior, data governance devel- ops and implements corporate-wide data policies, guidelines, and standards that are  consistent with the organization’s mission, strategy, values, norms, and culture”.'\n",

      "'Security is one of the major concerns for organisations who seek to adopt cloud  computing[110], with some managers reporting that their sensitive data will never  be in the cloud [111].'\n",
      "'There are several specific areas such as hardware and soft- ware, which require important security attention in the cloud environments.'\n",
      "'Issues  to consider in security include, the security of data at rest and motion, the security  of cloud data storage, and Incident response[112].'\n",
      "'▪  Privacy and data protection considerations are concerns for organisations inter- ested in implementing data governance in the cloud.'\n",
      "'This is because an organiza- tion  using  cloud  may  not  have  full  control  of  their  data  stored  on  cloud-based  servers [113].'\n",
      "'Cloud providers also don’t guarantee better confidentiality of cus- tomers data [114].'\n",

      "'It includes more extensive concepts such as reliability, en- ergy efficiency, and scalability  [116], [117].'\n",
      "'There are many factors which can  influence the performance of the cloud, such as security, recovery, service level  agreements, network bandwidth, storage capacity, availability, number of users  and data location [117].'\n",
      "'▪  Data classification in the cloud is another challenge for cloud consumers and pro- viders.'\n",

      "'Depending on the model, the cloud con- sumer loses control on their data, since the cloud provider has responsibility  to manage some components in these model[40].'\n",
      "'Therefore, the data govern- ance teams have to consider all characteristics of the service delivery model, '\n",

      "'   •  Cloud Actors: are also a critical factor into data governance for the cloud ser- vices.'\n",
      "'Cloud actors refers to a person or an organization that participates in  processes or a transaction, and/or performs tasks in cloud computing environ- ment.'\n",
      "'NISTs cloud computing reference architecture distinguishes five major  actors; the cloud consumer, the cloud provider, the cloud auditor, the cloud  carrier, and the cloud broker [9].'\n",
      "'All of the aforementioned have special roles  and responsibilities in the cloud, so the data governance teams must clearly  define the roles and responsibilities for all cloud actors.'\n",

      "'A SLA is an agreement  that serves as the foundation of expectation for service(s) between the cloud  consumer and the provider.'\n",
      "'The agreement states what services will be pro- vided, how they will be provided, and what happens if the expectations are not  met.'\n",
      "'Therefore, SLA is pivotal in data governance.'\n",
      "' Thus, the cloud consumer  and provider have to negotiate all aspects of data governance before develop- ing the SLA.'\n",

      "Data management solutions on their own are becoming  very expensive and  not able to cope with the reality of everlasting data complexity.\n",
      "Businesses have grown  more sophisticated in their use of data, which drives new demands that require different  ways to handle this data.\n",
      "Forward thinking organizations believe that the only way to  solve the data problem will be the implementation of an effective data governance.\n",
      "At- tempts in governing data failed before, as they were driven by IT, and affected by rigid  processes and fragmented activities carried out on system by system basis.\n",
      "Up to very  recently governance is mostly informal with very ambiguous and generic regulations, in  siloes around specific enterprise repositories, lacking structure and the wider support of  the organization.\n",
      "Despite its highly recognized importance, the area of data governance  is still under developed and under researched.\n",
      "Since data governance is still under re- searched, there is need to advance research in data governance in order to deepen prac- tice.\n",
      "Currently, what exist are mostly descriptive literature reviews in the area of data  governance.\n",
      "In this paper, a systematic literature review (SLR), which offers a structured,  methodical, and rigorous approach to the understanding of the state of the art of research  in data governance.\n",
      "The objective of the study is to provide a credible intellectual guide  for upcoming researchers in data governance to help them identify areas in data govern- ance research where they can make the most impact.\n",
      "The systematic literature review  covered published contributions from both academia and industry.\n",
      "The presented SLR  searches and examines most relevant published work since year 2000 to-date for data  governance for non-cloud, and for cloud computing since 2007.\n",
      "Only 52 studies met the  inclusion criteria, which are critically reviewed.\n",
      "The term ‘Governance’ in general refers to the way an organization goes about  ensuring that strategies are set, monitored, and achieved [3].\n",
      "As IT has become a back- bone of every organization, by definition IT governance becomes an integral part of  any  business  strategies  and  falls  under  the  corporate  governance.\n",
      "Historically,  data  emerged out of disparate legacy transactional systems.\n",
      "Then,  data was seen as a by-\n",
      "product of running the business and had little value beyond the transaction and the ap- plication that processed it, hence data was not treated as a valuable shared asset.\n",
      "This  continued until early 1990s, when the value of data started to take another trend beyond  transactions.\n",
      "Business decisions and processes started to be driven increasingly by data  and data analysis.\n",
      "Further investment in data management was the approach taken to  tackle the increasing volume, velocity and variety of data, such as complex data repos- itories, data warehouses, Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) and Customer Relation- ship Management(CRM)[4].\n",
      "Data links became very complex and shared amongst mul- tiple systems, and the need for providing a single point of reference in order to simplify  daily functions became crucial, which gave birth to the master data management [5].\n",
      "Data complexity and volume continue to explode; businesses have grown more so- phisticated in their use of data, which drives new demands that require different ways  to combine, manipulate, store, and present information; that forward thinking compa- nies recognized that data management solutions on their own are becoming very ex- pensive and not able to cope with business reality and they need to solve the data prob- lem in a different way[6].\n",
      "During this time, the notion of data governance started to  take a different direction, a more important one.\n",
      "Attempts in governing data failed be- fore, as they were driven by Information Technology (IT), and affected by rigid pro- cesses and fragmented activities carried out on system by system basis.\n",
      "Up to very re- cently, governance is mostly informal, in siloes around specific enterprise repositories,  lacking structure and the wider support of the organization.\n",
      "Despite its recognized high  importance, data governance is still an under-researched area and less practiced in in- dustry[4], [7].\n",
      "Researcher differ in defining data governance, the Data Governance In- stitute (DGI) defines it as follows “data governance is a system of decision rights and  accountabilities for information-related processes, executed according to agreed-upon  models which describe who can take what actions with what information, and when,  under what circumstances, using what methods”[8].\n",
      "The Na- tional  Institute of  Standards  and  Technology  (NIST)  defined  cloud  computing  as  “a  model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool  of  configurable  computing  resources  (e.g.,  networks,  servers,  storage,  applications,  and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management  effort or service provider interaction”[9].\n",
      "Cloud computing model enhance availability  and  is  composed of five  essential  characteristics,  four  deployment models  and  three  service  models[10].\n",
      "The  essential  characteristics  of  cloud  computing  include  on-de- mand self-service, broad network access, resource pooling, rapid elasticity and meas- ured service[11].\n",
      "In addition, cloud computing include three service  delivery  models which are: Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) and In- frastructure as a Service (IaaS)[14].\n",
      "Cloud computing offers potential benefits to public  and private organisations by making information technology (IT) services available as  a commodity[15], [16].\n",
      "The general claimed benefits of cloud computing include: cost  efficiency,  unlimited  storage,  backup  and  recovery,  automatic  software  integration,  easy access to information, quick deployment, easier scale of services and delivery of \n",
      "Furthermore, other benefits include: optimised server utilization, dy- namic scalability and minimised life cycle development of new applications.\n",
      "Though,  cloud computing is still not quite widely adopted because of many factors, but mostly  concerned with moving business data to be handled by third party[6] where in addition  to the cloud consumer and provider there are other actors; cloud auditor, cloud broker,  and cloud carrier [18].\n",
      "Therefore, loss of control on data, security and privacy of data,  data  quality  and  assurance, data  stewardship  etc  can  all  be  cited  as  real  concerns  of  adopting the cloud computing business model[6].\n",
      "Data lock-In is another potential risk,  whereupon cloud customers, who can face difficulties in extracting their data from the  cloud[19].\n",
      "Cloud consumers can also suffer from operational and regulatory challenges,  as organisations transfer their data to third parties for storage and processing[6].\n",
      "Also,  it may be difficult for the consumers to check the data handling practices of the cloud  provider or any of the other involved actors[15], [20], [21].\n",
      "The cloud computing model  is expected to be a highly disruptive technology and the adoption of its services will,  therefore, require an even more rigorous data governance strategies and programmes,  which can be more complex, but necessary.\n",
      "The authors’ general observation reveals that the area of data governance in general  is under researched and not widely practiced by organisations, let alone when it is con- cerned with cloud computing, where research is really in its infancy and far from reach- ing maturity.\n",
      "This forms the main motivation behind this paper, which attempts to pro- vide the readers with a comprehensive review on data governance in both non-cloud  and cloud computing.\n",
      "The contribution of this paper is unprecedented, where a System- atic Literature Review (SLR) principles are followed meticulously, to ensure all quality  attributes of the review, including reliability, suitability, relevance and completeness.\n",
      "The mapping study also delivers the first systematic summary of cloud data governance  research.\n",
      "The categorization of available publications helps researchers gain an over- view of the state-of-the-art research and current research gaps for cloud data govern- ance.\n",
      "Regarding a systematic literature review approach, in the literature there are many  authors were using this approach to investigate the state of the art of the different sub- ject.\n",
      "The study in [22] was used a systematic literature review to investigate the state  of the art of the agile information systems development.\n",
      "The authors in [23] were used  this approach for evaluating, identifying and interpreting all available re- search rele- vant to state of the art of the requirements traceability.\n",
      "In addition, [24] conducted a  systematic review about the state of the art of the agile governance up to and including  2013, the study aims to understand better this context, our paper seeks to investigate  how the domain of agile governance has evolved, as well as to derive implications for  research and practice.\n",
      "The  next  section  describes  the  general  methodology  followed  for  conducting  this  review, followed by Section 3 which present the data governance important.\n",
      "Then, state  of the art of data governance present in Section 4, and Section 5 shows the the system- atic review results analysis.\n",
      "Section 6 and 7 presents analysis of state of the art of data  governance for non cloud and cloud computing, respectively.\n",
      "This  research  is  carried  as  a  systematic  literature  review  (SLR),  as  described  by  Kitchenham and Charter [25].\n",
      "SLR is a mean of identifying, evaluating and interpreting  all available research relevant to a particular research question, topic or phenomenon  of  interest  [25].\n",
      "The  main  reason  for  undertaking  SLR  is  to  summarize  the  existing  information about data governance by identifying the state of the art of data governance  in non-cloud and cloud environments, and to get a true reflection on current data gov- ernance research and practice, determining possible directions for researchers based on  the current literatures.\n",
      "The steps followed to successful conduct this systematic litera- ture review were deduced from the pioneering work of Kitchenham and Charter [25],  depicted  in  Fig.1.  The  objective  of  this  study  is  to  investigate  and  analyse  the  most  relevant published research that has been carried out on data governance, for non-cloud  and cloud computing.\n",

      "It is important before conducting the SLR to define the context of data governance.\n",
      "This context will clarify what data governance and hence help eliminate all irrelevant  literature, which might be confused with the concept of data governance.\n",
      "For instance,  often researchers and practitioners confuse between data governance and data manage- ment.\n",
      "The definition of data management provided by the Data Management Associa- tion (DAMA) is: “data management is the development, execution and supervision of  plans, policies, programs and practices that control, protect, deliver and enhance the  value of data and information assets”.\n",
      "Data management in general focuses on the de- fining of the data element, how it is stored, structured, and moved.\n",
      "DAMA defines data  governance as: “the exercise of authority, control and shared decision-making (plan- ning, monitoring and enforcement) over the management of data assets”.\n",
      "Authors  of [27] have also argued that data governance is different from data management; that  data governance complements data management, but does  not replace it.\n",
      "Authors of  [28] defined data governance as “a system of decision rights and accountabilities for  information-related processes, executed according to agreed-upon models which de- scribe who can take what actions with what information, and when, under what cir- cumstances,  using  what  methods”.\n",
      "While  authors  of  [6]  defined  data  governance  as  “specifies the framework for decision rights and accountabilities to encourage desira- ble behavior in the use of data.\n",
      "To promote desirable behavior, data governance devel- ops and implements corporate-wide data policies, guidelines, and standards that are  consistent with the organization’s mission, strategy, values, norms, and culture”.\n",
      "However, there is not an official definition about what is data governance.\n",
      "For an- swering this question, this study is going to refer some different definitions offered by  important organisations.\n",
      "The definitions above emphasize the significance of the ter- minals though which data governance activities can be executing on data related assets  which support the organisation's strategy.\n",
      "all authors also agree that data governance  refers to the entirety of decision rights and responsibilities concerning the management  of data assets in organisations.\n",
      "These definitions did not give equal prominence for the  data governance with cloud computing technology context.\n",
      "So, this requires to under- stand the data governance and cloud computing in depth.\n",
      "Some other researchers or practitioners may also confuse between Information Tech- nology Governance (IT governance) and data governance.\n",
      "IT governance is much more  mature area with the first publications on the topic released about four decades[29],  [30], while data governance is still under-researched.\n",
      "defined IT governance as “in- tegral  part  of  enterprise  governance  and  have  potential  to  provide  mechanisms  for  leadership and organisational structures and processes that ensure the organisation’s  IT  sustains  and  extends  the  organisation’s  strategies  and objectives”.\n",
      "Organizations  with mature IT governance practices tend to have stronger alignment between IT and  business[31].\n",
      "Therefore, the different between data governance and IT governance is  data  governance  focus  on  govern  organisation  data  in  different  technology  environ- ment, while IT governance focus on govern IT equipment.\n",
      "In addition, [7] argues that  the organisations should get responsibility for data out of the IT department.\n",
      "Besides  of IT governance, data governance also has a significant role in aligning the organisa- tion's business[7].\n",
      "Data governance can be used to solve assortment of business issues  related to data and information[6], [32], [33].\n",
      "Authors of [29] also argued that a data  governance model helps organisations to structure and document the accountabilities  for their data quality.\n",
      "Authors of [34] have explicitly demonstrated that data governance  is different from IT governance in principal and practices.\n",
      "In principal, data governance  is  designed for  the governance  of  data  assets,  while  IT  governance  makes decisions  about IT investments, IT application portfolio, and the IT projects portfolio.\n",
      "In practice,  IT governance is designed primarily around an organization's hardware and applica- tions not its data.\n",
      "argues that the enterprise-wide data strategy and governance are important for  organisations, and they need these to achieve competitive advantage.\n",
      "In addition, all  existing sources have hitherto only addressed data governance, partially[29].\n",
      "The fact  that organisations need to take into account many aspects into consideration when im- plementing data governance has been neglected so far[36].\n",
      "Moreover, some researchers  show  that  if  organisations  who  do  not  implement  an  effective  data  governance,  can  quickly loose any competitive advantage[28], [35].\n",
      "illustrated that working with- out a proper data governance programme is analogous to an organisation allowing each  department and each employee to develop, for instance, its own financial chart of ac- counts.\n",
      "Data governance requires the involvement and commitment of all staff with full  sponsorship by the management and senior-level executive sponsorship in any organi- zation[37], [38].\n",
      "Recently, many organisations have become aware of the increasing importance of  governing their data, to ensure confidentiality, integrity, quality and availability of cus- tomers’ data[8], [39], [40].\n",
      "There is no single approach to the implementation of data  governance program in all organizations[37].\n",
      "A good data governance can help organ- isations to create a clear mission, achieve clarity, increase confidence of using the or- ganisational  data,  establish  accountabilities,  maintain  scope  and  focus,  and  define  measurable successes[4], [27].\n",
      "Moreover, many authors suggested that developing an  effective data governance will lead to many benefits for organizations.\n",
      "These benefits  are: enabling better decision-making, reduce operational friction, and protect the needs  of data stakeholders as central to a governance program[32], [41].\n",
      "In addition, other  benefits include: training of management and staff to adopt common approaches to data  issues,  build  standard,  repeatable  processes,  reduce  costs  and  increase  effectiveness  through coordination of efforts, and ensure transparency of processes[28], [32].\n",
      "Due to  one size does not fit all, therefore, for any organization who wish to develop their data  governance strategy, they should be regarded as guidelines the barriers and CSFs which  are influence to implement their strategy before developing their strategy.\n",

      "In the literature, a limited number of studies which have discussed the important  area of data governance.\n",
      "The roots of data governance research can be traced back to  early 1980s, however, the first efforts to propose a framework for data governance were  published in 2007 [6].\n",
      "also observed that all existing sources for data governance  from  researchers  and  practitioners,  at  the  time  he  published  his  paper,  focus  on  the  placement of decision-making authority for Data Quality Management (DQM) and or- ganizational structuring.\n",
      "reported that organizations who believe they have a data  governance program, in fact they did not consider all aspects required for these  pro- grams to be complete and effective.\n",
      "The work published by authors of [68] was the only  attempt in literature to review the area of  data governance, up until 2010.\n",
      "This work  aimed at developing morphology of data governance organisation.\n",
      "Six mini case studies  were used in this study to assess the morphology of the organisation of data governance.\n",
      "Other researcher such as [86] they suggested to transfer knowledge build in IT govern- ance into the development of data governance program.\n",
      "However, [67] argued that or- ganisations should establish a data governance structure to get responsibility for data  out of the IT department.\n",
      "According to [43], similar to IT governance, data governance  also  needs  to  align  with  any  organisation’s  business  strategy.\n",
      "argue  that  a  data  governance model helps organisations to structure and document the accountabilities  for their data quality.\n",
      "Other authors have also related data governance to accountability  such  as  [7],  [67];  also  [88]  stated  that  organisations  must  design  a  data  governance  model of roles responsibilities to identify people who have a level of accountability to \n",
      "define, produce and use the data in the organization.\n",
      "Authors of [7] has also outlined a  data governance model, which comprised of three components; data quality roles, de- cision areas and responsibilities.\n",
      "Data governance requires the participation and com- mitment of all IT staff, management and senior-level executive [89].\n",
      "reported  the  lack  or  even  the  absence  of  data  governance  frameworks.\n",
      "They  argued that an effective data governance framework can help organisations to create a  clear mission, achieve clarity, increase confidence of using the organisational data, es- tablish accountabilities, maintain scope and focus, and define measurable success cri- teria.\n",
      "In support of Fu et al argument, other authors added that a good data governance  framework supports compliance and legal efforts over the long term by organizing data  for retrieval and retention as well as building better relationships with customers and  partners, which enhance income opportunities [28], [68], [90].\n",
      "recommended the  implementation of the Enterprise Data Warehouse, in order to achieve an effective data  governance framework, which should be based on structure, process and communica- tion.\n",
      "Section 5.1 presents different data governance frameworks, emerging from this  systematic literature review.\n",
      "Despite the repeated call by researchers for the need of  data governance frameworks, our study shows only a handful of them, mainly devel- oped by industry associations such as DAMA, DGI and IBM IBM [6], [43], [57], [76],   In 2011 [68] proposed a framework for data governance, which consists of goals and  structure.\n",
      "The goals are divided into formal IT, business and functional goals, while the  structure is divided into focus of control, organizational form, and roles & committees.\n",
      "According to DGI, the development of data governance framework is a complex task  that could be formed of various related items that include programs, stages, decision  domain, universal objects, and components.\n",
      "DGI divides their framework (see Fig.5)  activity into three components, namely the rules & roles, people and organizations [43],  [91].\n",
      "In addition, IBM's approach to data governance was built from the perspective of  the vendor data governance software provider, so establishing a data governance will  require software support [43], [92].\n",
      "This Model shows that the organizations need to  ensure that the business and IT problems must be clearly defined, with full executive   [43].\n",
      "The IBM model include fourteen elements, ten of them are required and four are  optional (see Fig.6) [43], [92], [93].\n",
      "In 2010 [4] focused more on defining critical success factors for an effective data  governance, which he categorized into organizational and technological  success fac- tors.\n",
      "The organizational factors  include  clear  definition of roles  and  responsibilities,  business and IT involvement, executive sponsorship and Integration competency cen- ter.\n",
      "The technological factors include the automation of data integration life cycle to  deliver on the goals of data  governance.\n",
      "have  also identified some critical data  governance success factors to include  strategic accountability, standards, managerial  blind spots, embracing complexities of data, cross divisional issue, data quality metrics,  partnership with other companies, strategic points of control, training and awareness of  data stakeholders and compliance monitoring.\n",
      "Successful data governance, therefore,  requires bringing together a diverse expertise from various departments into any one  organisation  to  achieve  consistency,  transparency  and  repeatability  of processes  that  enable best data-related decision making  [95]and establish accountabilities, maintain  scope and focus, and define measurable successes [4]  and support compliance and legal  efforts over the long term by organising data for retrieval and retention[32], and im- prove income opportunities and customer and partner relationships[31].\n",

      "There are little studies reported on data govern- ance  for  the  cloud  services.\n",
      "Almost  all  existing  work  on  data  governance  for  cloud  computing focus on accountability and Interoperability [11],  [13].\n",
      "The research pre- sented in [47] proposed a model that explains data governance in terms of accountabil- ity attributes and cloud-mediated interactions between actors.\n",
      "According to authors of  [47] and alike, it is accountability that identifies the relationships between cloud actors  in  terms  of  data  governance;  it  also  enhances  trust  between  cloud  actors  [47],[106].\n",
      "Accountability could be addressed at different levels, technological, regulatory and or- ganizational [107].\n",
      "Authors of [47] define accountability as:”accountability consists of  defining governance to comply in a responsible manner with internal and external cri- teria, ensuring implementation of appropriate actions, explaining and justifying those  actions  and  remedying  any  failure  to  act  properly”.\n",
      "As  result,  accountability  is  one  aspect of cloud data  governance, therefore that is not quite  enough to achieve cloud  data governance goals.\n",

      "According to authors  in [60],[108],[63],[39], Cloud Security Alliance, Trustworthy Computing Group, and  Microsoft corporation are regarded as the recognized leaders in this area.\n",
      "The Cloud  Security Alliance cloud data governance working group currently focuses on the data  protection aspect, with an aim to propose a data governance framework for ensuring  the availability, integrity, privacy and overall security of data in different cloud models;  this is far from being realized [108].\n",

      "Critical challenges to implement data governance in cloud  \n",
      "The adoption of new technology such as cloud computing in organisations require a  good data governance strategy for the adoption to be successful  [4].\n",
      "There are many  challenging issues  which  could  affect the  implementation  of data  governance in  the  cloud, these can be classified as technological, legal, and business, and are discussed  below.\n",
      "Security is one of the major concerns for organisations who seek to adopt cloud  computing[110], with some managers reporting that their sensitive data will never  be in the cloud [111].\n",
      "There are several specific areas such as hardware and soft- ware, which require important security attention in the cloud environments.\n",
      "Issues  to consider in security include, the security of data at rest and motion, the security  of cloud data storage, and Incident response[112].\n",
      "Privacy and data protection considerations are concerns for organisations inter- ested in implementing data governance in the cloud.\n",
      "This is because an organiza- tion  using  cloud  may  not  have  full  control  of  their  data  stored  on  cloud-based  servers [113].\n",
      "Cloud providers also don’t guarantee better confidentiality of cus- tomers data [114].\n",
      "Therefore, the aspect of security and confidentiality must in- terface to protect the data in enterprises.\n",
      "Availability has become a concern to adopting the cloud and implementing data  governance in organisations  [115].\n",
      "A number of factors exist which negatively  impact on availability in the cloud, these include security, protecting the confi- dentiality and integrity of data, and Identifying single points of failure [115].\n",
      "Performance is one of the concerns for organisations when moving their service  and data to the cloud.\n",
      "It includes more extensive concepts such as reliability, en- ergy efficiency, and scalability  [116], [117].\n",
      "There are many factors which can  influence the performance of the cloud, such as security, recovery, service level  agreements, network bandwidth, storage capacity, availability, number of users  and data location [117].\n",
      "This challenge emanates from the lack of classification of data based on  sensitivity.\n",
      "The protection of sensitive data is important for any organisation when  moving data to the cloud.\n",
      "Classification of data facilitates the implementation of  appropriate security controls such as role-based access, among many others.\n",
      "This  has also been a major area of concern for consumers of cloud services, because  they are not aware who is accessing their data.\n",
      "As a result, assuring cloud service  consumers that their data is not being accessed by unauthorized parties has been  a major challenge to cloud service providers [118].\n",
      "Data migration is another significant concern in cloud computing which is related   to data governance [119], [120].\n",
      "There are a number of considerations that should  be made when migrating data between different cloud systems.\n",
      "These considera- tions include scalability, availability, load balancing, cost-efficiency and availa- bility  [121].\n",
      "Load balancing ensures that servers are  not overwhelmed by data.\n",
      "Requests are distributed between multiple servers, which ensures very quick op- erations on the data stored on the cloud [36].\n",
      "Legal  contracts  written  between  cloud  actors  are  expressed  in  very  complicated  statements.\n",
      "Hence, customers find it very difficult to understand legal and regulatory  implications of such agreements [122].\n",
      "The legal framework for cloud computing still  remains at an unsatisfactory level in many countries [123].\n",
      "For example, Middle East- ern countries and Africa lack compulsory regulatory support for data protection, gov- ernance, and privacy [122], [124].\n",
      "There are many legal factors which affect an organ- ization when implementing data governance in the cloud.\n",
      "These  include compliance  with regulations, and physical location [102].\n",
      "In addition, statutory, regulatory, and le- gal requirements differ by market sector and jurisdiction, and they can change the re- sponsibilities of both cloud consumers and cloud providers.\n",
      "compliance with such re- quirements is often related to activities of risk management and governance [125].\n",
      "Cloud computing supports organisations in embracing new business opportunities to  improve their current business performance, respond to crisis  situations, and change  their current business model [34], [102].\n",
      "In addition, data governance strategy is essen- tial for supporting business functions in any organisations [4].\n",
      "There are many organi- zational factors that affect an organisation’s implementation of data governance pro- grams  in  the  cloud.\n",
      "These    include  top  management  support,  organization  size,  and  technology readiness [102], [126].\n",
      "Additionally, currently there is no single approach  to the implementation of data governance in all organisations.\n",
      "Literature review identi- fies a significant gap in the lack of appropriate and effective data governance in the  cloud.\n",
      "Organisations need to embrace data governance program in the cloud, no matter  where data is created, used and stored.\n",
      "Nonetheless, technological, legal, and organiza- tional  challenges  are  among  the  many  challenges  that  impact  on  implementing  data  governance in the cloud.\n",
      "Many researchers have recognized a need to implement data governance for cloud  computing[47],[105],[40],[48].\n",
      "To  implement  data  governance  for  cloud  computing,  services must determine the data governance key dimension.\n",
      "Identifying the specific  data  governance  dimensions  for  the  cloud  services  is  potentially  a  complex  process,  consequently, it needs more investigative efforts involving different stakeholders.\n",
      "Thus,  the study presented here is based merrily on analyzing the relevant knowledge in the  public domain, following the Analytic Theory[127].\n",
      "has  been  useful  for  understanding  data  governance  aspects  for  traditional  IT  and  the  cloud technology.\n",
      "The authors in [68] urge that the use of the analytic theory to describe  or classify specific dimensions or characteristics of individuals, groups,  situations, or  events,  by  summarizing  the  commonalities  found  in  discrete  observations”.\n",
      "The analytic theory  has been chosen as a concept for this study to identify data governance dimensions for  the cloud services.\n",
      "To use analytic theory for making data governance dimensions, we  follow a number of steps.\n",
      "Foremost, to understand the state-of-the art of data governance  for traditional IT, and the cloud.\n",
      "In addition, to identify specific dimensions or charac- teristics of data governance and cloud computing.\n",
      "Finally, to develop the key data gov- ernance dimensions for cloud computing based on the definitions of data governance  and its factors that present in the literature review.\n",
      "To the best of our knowledge, and  following the aforementioned systematic review of literature, there is no published re- search that defines key dimensions of data governance for cloud computing.\n",
      "In contrast,  for traditional IT (non-cloud), although few, there is some reported research.\n",
      "As illus- trated above, data governance for non-cloud and cloud, albeit with some similarities at  a higher level, differ significantly in the details, in addition to some new factors related  only to the cloud technology mentioned.\n",
      "Therefore, it is useful to discuss these similar- ities and differences.\n",
      "Data governance for traditional IT (non-cloud) could be built upon  six dimensions, which are described below:  \n",
      "The cloud paradigm however, introduces new factors, which needs to be taken into  consideration when designing and implementing any cloud data governance program.\n",
      "These new factors are described below.\n",
      "By considering these new factors, the key di- mensions for implementing data governance for cloud computing are depicted in Fig.7.  •  Cloud deployment model: it is the important factor that consider in the data  governance.\n",
      "There are primarily four cloud deployment models that differ in  risk and concern about control and security, and contractual barriers.\n",
      "To address data governance, the level  of risk and complexity of each cloud deployment must be taken into consider- ation[9].\n",
      "Service delivery model: cloud services can be categorized into three delivery  models; Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and  In- frastructure as a Service (IaaS)[128].\n",
      "Depending on the model, the cloud con- sumer loses control on their data, since the cloud provider has responsibility  to manage some components in these model[40].\n",
      "Therefore, the data govern- ance teams have to consider all characteristics of the service delivery model, \n",
      "and define appropriate policies to enforce control roles and responsibilities.\n",
      "Cloud actors refers to a person or an organization that participates in  processes or a transaction, and/or performs tasks in cloud computing environ- ment.\n",
      "NISTs cloud computing reference architecture distinguishes five major  actors; the cloud consumer, the cloud provider, the cloud auditor, the cloud  carrier, and the cloud broker [9].\n",
      "All of the aforementioned have special roles  and responsibilities in the cloud, so the data governance teams must clearly  define the roles and responsibilities for all cloud actors.\n",
      "Contractual barriers increase between cloud actors.\n",
      "A SLA is an agreement  that serves as the foundation of expectation for service(s) between the cloud  consumer and the provider.\n",
      "The agreement states what services will be pro- vided, how they will be provided, and what happens if the expectations are not  met.\n",
      "Thus, the cloud consumer  and provider have to negotiate all aspects of data governance before develop- ing the SLA.\n",
      "As a result, these agreements are in place to protect both parties.\n",
      "Data governance function: This refers to master activities for data governance,  including functions which data governance teams have to take in account when \n",
      "implementing data governance programs  [95].\n",
      "The outcomes from data gov- ernance  function  activities  include  policies,  principles,  processes,  decision  rights,  roles  and  responsibilities,  communication  plans  and  change  manage- ment.\n",
      "This is considered the master dimension for data governance, nonethe- less, it must comply with other dimensions to develop an effective data gov- ernance.\n",
      "Data  governance  structure:  Designing  data  governance  structure  is  an  im- portant factor in ensuring that requisite roles and responsibilities are addressed  throughout the enterprise at the right organizational levels [28].\n",
      "Several com- mon data governance roles have been identified in existing studies, including  the  following:  executive  sponsor,  data  governance  council,  data  governance  office, chief Steward, business and technical data Steward [7],[31].\n",
      "These roles  have to collaborate to formulate data governance bodies.\n",
      "Data governance requires change management in the organi- zation, in addition to the participation and commitment of IT staff, business  management,  and  senior-level  executive  sponsorship  in  organizations  [31].\n",
      "Moreover, top management support is considered as the critical success factor  for  implementing  data  governance  [28].\n",
      "Staff  in  organizations  need  to  learn  data governance functions, demanding top management support to enhance an  organization staffs’ skillset.\n",
      "Therefore,  lack  of  technology  considers  common  barriers  to  successful  data  governance.\n",
      "Technical factors encapsulate data management issues that affect  organisations’  strategies  such  as  security,  privacy,  quality  and  integrity.\n",
      "As  such, it is incumbent upon organisations which anticipate to implement data  governance, to assess all technological characteristics available at the organi- sations, to effectively implement data governance.\n",
      "Environmental: Environmental factors refers to external environmental consid- erations such as government legislation, and data protection act[102].\n",
      "The data  governance teams have to consider all environmental aspects when designing  data governance functions.\n",
      "This means that data governance functions have to  comply with the environments.\n",
      "This consideration immensely contributes  to- wards building strong data governance in the organisation.\n",
      "Measuring & Monitoring Tool: Measuring and monitoring supports ongoing  data  governance  efforts  to  ensure  that  all  incoming  and  existing  data  meets  business  rules  [38].\n",
      "By  adding  a  monitoring  component  to  data  governance  program, data quality efforts are enhanced, which in turn renders data much  more reliable [26].\n",
      "As mentioned above, the above six dimensions are common  when implementing data governance for cloud or traditional IT, however, they \n",
      "differ in their implementations.\n",
      "Table 11 is an attempt to show some of these  differences.\n",
      "Illustrates how the six common defined dimensions differ between the Cloud par- adigm and traditional IT(non-cloud)        \n",
      "All data governance policies  are handled in-house.\n",
      "The infrastructure is on-site,  and all aspects of data gov- ernance are left to the local  administrators.\n",
      "Local employees in- volved in data govern- ance structure.\n",

      "Data policies are put in place, however, it is  up to the third party to ensure that guide- lines are followed.\n",
      "The infrastructure is multi-site, hence new  entities become involved in data govern- ance structure, such as the cloud manager,  cloud provider and cloud broker.\n",
